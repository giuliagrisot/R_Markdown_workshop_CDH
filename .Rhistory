knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=F)
# At the beginning of a chunk, you will often see "library(xxxxxx)". It indicates that a package has been loaded. Different packages perform different operations. For example, the package "readr" allows R to read the CSV file into a dataframe.
# We want to call this dataframe "students_performance".
# Exercise:
# Uncomment the code below and insert the name of the dataframe in the spaces demarcated with XXXX.
# You can run the code chunk to see if it works and have a look at the output without knitting the whole document. Once you have added the dataframe name to the code, click on the little green arrow on the top right of the code block, try and see what happens.
