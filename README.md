## Welcome!

This is the repository containing all you will need to complete the workshop **Introduction to R Studio and R Markdown**, which will take place in the **IT Training Room, Cambridge University Library** on teh 21st of November 2022 between 13:00 and 17:00.

Here you can find [resources](00_Resources_and_readings/resources.md) that will allow you to make the most of our summer school, which include links to some useful tutorials and a few recommended readings. These should give you an idea of what R and R Studio are, and why they could be useful to you.

## Get ready

**If you are completely new to R and R Studio** - for instance if you are asking yourself, *" R what..?!?"* - we think **it might be very useful for you to start familiarising with these tools** and their interfaces.
If you do not have R and R Studio already on your computer, we recommend that you install the latest versions of these two software, which are **free** for everyone.
You can install R like any other program from [this link (Windows users)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [this (for Mac users)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). 

After installing R (your "engine"), we need to install RStudio (your "interface"). You can do that from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Install the *Free* version.

If you don't have time for this, don't worry too much.
We will still go through all the basics with you at the beginning of the Workshop, with some time dedicated almost exclusively to making you comfortable with these new tools.
However, it can be quite overwhelming to "get into" it, all of a sudden, within one day, so we recommend that - if you have time - you try and install them earlier on, and maybe explore and play a little around them.

To make the impact a little smoother, we also suggest that you go have a look at some of the many existing tutorials offering an introduction to R and R Studio, such as [this pdf tutorial](00_Resources_and_readings/R_RStudio_Basics.pdf), [this online beginners' tutorial](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/), or [this one (also for beginners)](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html).

You will find more links in the [resources](00_Resources_and_readings/resources.md) section.

## Help us give you the best experience

The Workshop will help you discover the potential of R Markdown, showing you how this tool can be used to create wonderful reports, to make sure you succeed in producing reproducible research, and, last but not least, to allow you to spare a lot of time and energy!

**Please remember to fill the [participants' survey](https://forms.gle/RzxQi1LqKRnACQJo6) by November 15th**, which will allow us to customise the workshop based on the participants' experiences and interests.
