<div id="how-to-create-a-corpus-of-texts-for-analyses-with-r-studio" class="section level1">
<h1>How to create a corpus of texts for analyses with R Studio</h1>
<div id="recap" class="section level2">
<h2>RECAP:</h2>
<p>This is an R Markdown file, created by Giulia (reads like English
“Julia”). It is the R Markdwown version of the base R script
“Creating_texts_corpus.R”.</p>
<p>Everything written in black is just regular text (the equivalent of
the green text in the R script, also know as “comments”.</p>
<p>Everything in “R chunks” is R code. To execute the code, place the
cursor on the corresponding line and press Ctrl+Enter (windows) or
Cmd+Enter (mac).</p>
<p>To complete this script, you will not need much knowledge of R: the
codes are provided for you. If you are unfamiliar with R language and
basic operations and want to learn more about it, there is plenty of
tutorials online. Have a look at the resources at the end of this script
for a few recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>now we’re ready to start!</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creating-your-dataset" class="section level1">
<h1>Creating your dataset</h1>
<p>Often, one of the factors that prevents us humanists from working
with RStudio for analysing texts is that tutorials assume a certain
amount of (magically) pre-existing knowledge. Unfortunately, we often do
not have that, nor a magic wand. So it happens that right when you want
to finally try to use someone else’s existing scripts and make them work
with your lovely literary texts (yes, thas’s how we often do, and it’s
ok!), you are not really sure how to put those books into a shape that
you can use.</p>
<p>Here we will try and show how different text formats can be imported
in R and made ready for some analysis.</p>
<div id="packages" class="section level2">
<h2>packages</h2>
<p>Before you begin you will need to load some packages. These allow you
to execute specific operations. Packages need to be installed first. you
can do that from the “Packages” panel, on the right, or by executing
these lines in your console:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;data.table&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;tm&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;tidytext&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;syuzhet&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;sjPlot&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;wordcloud&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;readxl&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>NB!! You only need to intall packages ONCE. R stores that
information, and after the installation you only need to “load” them, to
activate them when you are running code. If R asks you whether you want
to install dependencies for the packages, say yes.</p>
<p>What you will need to do every time you restart RStudio to work on a
script is to load the packages you’ll need, as we are doing here
below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(data.table)
library(tm)
library(tidytext)
library(sjPlot)
library(wordcloud)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="importing-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Importing data</h1>
<div id="txt" class="section level2">
<h2>txt</h2>
<p>One easy way to import texts into R is to start from txt files.</p>
<p>You might have more than one, so it is important that you store them
all together in one folder, and ideally with a consistent filename.
Information in the filename can be used later on to add metadata to your
dataset. The format “surname_title_year.txt” could be a good option, for
example, where the surname and the title have to be one word.</p>
<p>In order to import a txt file, you can use the “read.delim” function
from base R (which means you do not need to install extra packages).</p>
<p>let’s try it out. As you can see in the files panels, there is a
folder called “samples”, where some texts in different formats are
stored.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pride &lt;- read.delim(&quot;samples/austen_pride_1813.txt&quot;, # this is the url to your file
                    fileEncoding = &quot;utf-8&quot;,  # we want to read it as unicode text
                    header = F) %&gt;% # we do not want the first line as a header 
  rename(text = V1) # we can name the column text</code></pre>
<p>your file has been imported! Have a look at the first rows to see how
it looks execute the next code cunk or click on the “pride” element in
your environment</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(pride)</code></pre>
<div class="kable-table">
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">text</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">IT IS A TRUTH universally acknowledged, that a single
man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</td>

<tr class="even">

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Mr. Bennet made no answer.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>when importing a txt file, the paragraphs are automatically converted
into new rows. if you want to have a single string instead, you can
transform it, telling R to combine the rows, and to add “” (a
conventional code for a new line) between one piece of string and the
next, as follows:</p>

<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on
his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the
minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,”
said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is
let at last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned
she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer. “Do not you want to know who has taken it?”
cried his wife impatiently. “You want to tell me, and I have no
objection to hearing it.” This was invitation enough. “Why, my dear, you
must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of
large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in
a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it
that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.” “Is he
married or single?” “Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of
large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our
girls!” “How so? how can it affect them?” “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied
his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking
of his marrying one of them.” “Is that his design in settling here?”
“Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may
go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still
better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might
like you the best of the party.” “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly
have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing
extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought
to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “In such cases, a woman has
not often much beauty to think of.” “But, my dear, you must indeed go
and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “It is more
than I engage for, I assure you.” “But consider your daughters. Only
think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and
Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general
you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be
impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.” “You are over scrupulous
surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will
send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his
marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a
good word for my little Lizzy.” “I desire you will do no such thing.
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half
so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are
always giving her the preference.” “They have none of them much to
recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other
girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”
“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take
delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.” “You
mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my
old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
twenty years at least.” “Ah! you do not know what I suffer.” “But I hope
you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a
year come into the neighbourhood.” “It will be no use to us, if twenty
such should come since you will not visit them.” “Depend upon it, my
dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.” Mr. Bennet was
so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice,
that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to
make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to
develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and
uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace
was visiting and news. MR. BENNET WAS AMONG the earliest of those who
waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to
the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the
evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was
then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter
employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, “I hope
Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.” “We are not in a way to know what
Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are not to
visit.” “But you forget, mama,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him
at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.” “I
do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
her.” “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you
do not depend on her serving you.” Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any
reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her
daughters. “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a
little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.” “Kitty has no
discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.” “I do
not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is your
next ball to be, Lizzy?” “To-morrow fortnight.” “Aye, so it is,” cried
her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so,
it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know
him herself.” “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend,
and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.” “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible,
when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?” “I
honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very
little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long
and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think
it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on
myself.” The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,
“Nonsense, nonsense!” “What can be the meaning of that emphatic
exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and
the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with
you there. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep
reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.” Mary wished
to say something very sensible, but knew not how. “While Mary is
adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.” “I
am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife. “I am sorry to hear that; but
why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning,
I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I
have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of
Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of
joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all
the while. “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I
should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.” “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you
chuse,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued
with the raptures of his wife. “What an excellent father you have,
girls,” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will
ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At
our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new
acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.
Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will
dance with you at the next ball.” “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not
afraid; for though I am the youngest, I’m the tallest.” The rest of the
evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s
visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. NOT ALL THAT
Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could
ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any
satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various
ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant
surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last
obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady
Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted
with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable,
and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large
party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a
certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of
Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained. “If I can but see one of my
daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her
husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing
to wish for.” In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and
sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes
of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. An invitation
to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet
planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an
answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in
town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of
their invitation, &amp;c. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could
not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his
arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always
flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield
as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the
idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball;
and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies
and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over
such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by
hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from
London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the
assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether, Mr. Bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend. Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all
the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced
every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of
giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters. Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged,
by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during
part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to
overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the
dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. “Come, Darcy,”
said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by
yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.” “I certainly
shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted
with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room,
whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.” “I would not
be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a kingdom! Upon my
honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have
this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.”
“You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said
Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. “Oh! she is the most
beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters
sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very
agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” “Which do you
mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till
catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, “She is
tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at
present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other
men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you
are wasting your time with me.” Mr. Bingley followed his advice.
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial
feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among
her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted
in any thing ridiculous. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to
the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired
by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she
had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by
this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt
Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the
most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had
been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that
they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in
good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which
they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up.
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he
had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had
raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his
wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found
that he had a very different story to hear. “Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as
she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most
excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing
could be like it. Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley
thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of
that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only
creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked
Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however,
he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he
seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he
enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two
next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth
with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth
with Lizzy, and the Boulanger.” “If he had had any compassion for me,”
cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much!
For God’s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained
his ancle in the first dance!” “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I
am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his
sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw any thing more
elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy. “But I can assure
you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his
fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth
pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He
walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not
handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to
have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.” WHEN JANE
AND ELIZABETH were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her
praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she
admired him. “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she,
“sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so
much ease, with such perfect good breeding!” “He is also handsome,”
replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be, if he
possibly can. His character is thereby complete.” “I was very much
flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such
a compliment.” “Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great
difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me
never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could
not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other
woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he
certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have
liked many a stupider person.” “Dear Lizzy!” “Oh! you are a great deal
too apt you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in
any body. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never
heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.” “I would wish not to
be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.” “I know
you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to
be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation
of candour is common enough;—one meets it every where. But to be candid
without ostentation or design—to take the good of every body’s character
and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you
alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters too, do you? Their manners
are not equal to his.” “Certainly not; at first. But they are very
pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with
her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not
find a very charming neighbour in her.” Elizabeth listened in silence,
but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been
calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation
and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too
unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to
approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good
humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where
they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had
been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a
fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more
than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were
therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and
meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of
England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than
that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.—Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase. His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his
own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley
was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst,
who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to
consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not
been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental
recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into
it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship,
in spite of a great opposition of character.—Bingley was endeared to
Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no
disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with
his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s
regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest
opinion. In understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no
means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offence. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly
was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter
people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and
attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon
felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be
so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a
sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss
Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt
authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. WITHIN A
SHORT WALK of longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were
particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in
Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour
of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty. The
distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him
courteous. Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to
be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.—They had several children. The
eldest of them a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth’s intimate friend. That the Miss Lucases and the Miss
Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and
the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear
and to communicate. “You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said
Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “You were
Mr. Bingley’s first choice.” “Yes;—but he seemed to like his second
better.” “Oh!—you mean Jane, I suppose—because he danced with her twice.
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he
did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about
Mr. Robinson.” “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and
Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how
he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were
a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the
prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question—Oh! the
eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that
point.” “Upon my word!—Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem
as if—but however, it may all come to nothing you know.” “My
overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.” “I beg you would not put
it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a
disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.
Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour
without once opening his lips.” “Are you quite sure, Ma’am?—is not there
a little mistake?” said Jane.—“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to
her.” “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and
he could not help answering her;—but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to.” “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never
speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is
remarkably agreeable.” “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he
had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can
guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I
dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,
and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.” “I do not mind his not
talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I wish he had danced with
Eliza.” “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with
him, if I were you.” “I believe, Ma’am, I may safely promise you never
to dance with him.” “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so
much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot
wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing
in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it,
he has a right to be proud.” “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth,
“and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” “If I were
as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, “I
should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and
drink a bottle of wine every day.” “Then you would drink a great deal
more than you ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it
I should take away your bottle directly.” The boy protested that she
should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument
ended only with the visit. THE LADIES OF Longbourn soon waited on those
of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s
pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley;
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger
sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with
them, was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was
received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw
superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even
her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such
as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence
of their brother’s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they
met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane
was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him
from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she
considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the
world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a
composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would
guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to
her friend Miss Lucas. “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte,
“to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes
a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection
with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity
of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the
world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in
almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We
can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there
are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” “But she
does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive
her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it
too.” “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you
do.” “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to
conceal it, he must find it out.” “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of
her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for
many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed
parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in
conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half
hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him,
there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.” “Your
plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question
but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a
rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these
are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot
even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.” “Not as you represent it.
Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he
had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been
also spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal.” “Yes; these
four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like
Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading
characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” “Well,”
said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were
married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of
happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.” “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it
is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware;—to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with. He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step
towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with
others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s,
where a large party were assembled. “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she
to Charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”
“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.” “But if he does it
any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He
has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent
myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.” On his approaching them soon
afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking,
Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which
immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,
“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?” “With great energy;—but it is a subject which always makes a
lady energetic.” “You are severe on us.” “It will be her turn soon to be
teazed,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and
you know what follows.” “You are a very strange creature by way of a
friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every
body!—If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been
invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before
those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On
Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it must be
so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old
saying, which every body here is of course familiar with—‘Keep your
breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display. Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though
vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic
air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of
excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had
been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so
well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase
praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her
younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers
joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. Mr. Darcy stood near
them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the
exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own
thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir
William thus began. “What a charming amusement for young people this is,
Mr. Darcy!—There is nothing like dancing after all.—I consider it as one
of the first refinements of polished societies.” “Certainly, Sir,—and it
has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished
societies of the world.—Every savage can dance.” Sir William only
smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully;” he continued after a pause,
on seeing Bingley join the group;—“and I doubt not that you are an adept
in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.” “You saw me dance at Meryton, I
believe, Sir.” “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure
from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?” “Never, Sir.” “Do
you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?” “It is a
compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.” “You have
a house in town, I conclude.” Mr. Darcy bowed. “I had once some thoughts
of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did
not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady
Lucas.” He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not
disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them,
he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called
out to her, “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?—Mr. Darcy, you
must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable
partner.—You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is
before you.” And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy,
who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when
she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,
“Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.—I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. “You excel so much in
the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of
seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general,
he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.”
“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling. “He is
indeed—but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot
wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?”
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley, “I can guess the
subject of your reverie.” “I should imagine not.” “You are considering
how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in
such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more
annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the
self-importance of all these people!—What would I give to hear your
strictures on them!” “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My
mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very
great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman
can bestow.” Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and
desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such
reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity, “Miss Elizabeth
Bennet.” “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all
astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray when am I
to wish you joy?” “That is exactly the question which I expected you to
ask. A lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to
love, from love to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me
joy.” “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter
as absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed,
and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.” He listened to
her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in
this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her
wit flowed long. MR. BENNET’S PROPERTY consisted almost entirely in an
estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters
was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their
mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill
supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in
Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. She had a sister married
to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded
him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable
line of trade. The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton;
a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually
tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their
aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the
family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these
attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when
nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their
morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare
of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was
the head quarters. Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of
the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their
knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were
not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers
themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces
a source of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but
officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave
animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to
the regimentals of an ensign. After listening one morning to their
effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed, “From all that I
can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest
girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now
convinced.” Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia,
with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of
Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as
he was going the next morning to London. “I am astonished, my dear,”
said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so ready to think your own
children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of any body’s children,
it should not be of my own however.” “If my children are silly I must
hope to be always sensible of it.” “Yes—but as it happens, they are all
of them very clever.” “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on
which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in
every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two
youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.” “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must
not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.—When
they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any
more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red-coat myself very
well—and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,
with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall
not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming
the other night at Sir William’s in his regimentals.” “Mama,” cried
Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go
so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first came; she sees
them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.” Mrs. Bennet was
prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss
Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.
Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling
out, while her daughter read, “Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it
about? what does he say? well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste,
my love.” “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
My Dear Friend, IF you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with
Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest
of our lives, for a whole day’s tête-à-tête between two women can never
end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. Yours ever,
Caroline Bingley. “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt
did not tell us of that.” “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very
unlucky.” “Can I have the carriage,” said Jane. “No, my dear, you had
better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you
must stay all night.” “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if
you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.” “Oh! but the
gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton; and the
Hursts have no horses to theirs.” “I had much rather go in the coach.”
“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?” “They are wanted in the
farm much oftener than I can get them.” “But if you have got them
to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose will be answered.” She did
at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were
engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother
attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained
hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The
rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly
could not come back. “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said
Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all
her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the
felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant
from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: My Dearest
Lizzy, I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to
be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on my
seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his
having been to me—and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not
much the matter with me. Yours, &amp;C. “Well, my dear,” said
Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, “if your daughter
should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a
comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under
your orders.” “Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not
die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as
she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could
have the carriage.” Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to
go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no
horse-woman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her
resolution. “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of
such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you
get there.” “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.” “Is
this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”
“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.” “I
admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.” “We will
go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.—Elizabeth
accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together. “If
we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may see
something of Captain Carter before he goes.” In Meryton they parted; the
two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers’ wives, and
Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a
quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with
impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the
house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the
warmth of exercise. She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all
but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal
of surprise.—That she should have walked three miles so early in the
day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held
her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by
them; and in their brother’s manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.—Mr. Darcy said very
little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The
latter was thinking only of his breakfast. Her enquiries after her
sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and
though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had
only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from
expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was
delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much
conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt
little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness
she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her. When breakfast
was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like
them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed
for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as
might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they
must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,
and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the
feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did
not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent;
the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere. When
the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes. AT FIVE O’CLOCK the two ladies retired to
dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the
civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the
pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of
Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by
no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four
times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad
cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then
thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when
not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all
her original dislike. Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the
party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane
was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they
prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she
was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but
him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less
so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man,
who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her
prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her. When dinner
was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing
her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to
be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no
conversation, no stile, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added, “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being
an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning.
She really looked almost wild.” “She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly
keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be
scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so
untidy, so blowsy!” “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her
petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown
which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office.” “Your picture
may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was all lost upon
me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she
came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my
notice.” “You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley;
“and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister
make such an exhibition.” “Certainly not.” “To walk three miles, or four
miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and
alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an
abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town
indifference to decorum.” “It shews an affection for her sister that is
very pleasing,” said Bingley. “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss
Bingley, in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected
your admiration of her fine eyes.” “Not at all,” he replied; “they were
brightened by the exercise.”—A short pause followed this speech, and
Mrs. Hurst began again. “I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she
is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well
settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I
am afraid there is no chance of it.” “I think I have heard you say, that
their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.” “Yes; and they have another, who
lives somewhere near Cheapside.” “That is capital,” added her sister,
and they both laughed heartily. “If they had uncles enough to fill all
Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less
agreeable.” “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying
men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy. To this speech
Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and
indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend’s
vulgar relations. With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired
to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till
summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not
quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of
seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than
pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. On entering the
drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately
invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she
declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse
herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. Mr. Hurst
looked at her with astonishment. “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said
he; “that is rather singular.” “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley,
“despises cards. She is a great reader and has no pleasure in any thing
else.” “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried
Elizabeth; “I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many
things.” “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said
Bingley; “and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite
well.” Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded. “And I wish my collection were
larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and
though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into.” Elizabeth
assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the
room. “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have
left so small a collection of books.—What a delightful library you have
at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!” “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has
been the work of many generations.” “And then you have added so much to
it yourself, you are always buying books.” “I cannot comprehend the
neglect of a family library in such days as these.” “Neglect! I am sure
you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.
Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful
as Pemberley.” “I wish it may.” “But I would really advise you to make
your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of
model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.” “With
all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.” “I am
talking of possibilities, Charles.” “Upon my word, Caroline, I should
think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game. “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the
spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will she be as tall as I am?” “I think she
will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or rather
taller.” “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who
delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners!—and so extremely
accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is
exquisite.” “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can
have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are.” “All young
ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?” “Yes, all of
them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses. I
scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never
heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed
that she was very accomplished.” “Your list of the common extent of
accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has too much truth. The word is applied
to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or
covering a skreen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your
estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than
half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really
accomplished.” “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley. “Then,” observed
Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an
accomplished woman.” “Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.” “Oh!
certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed
accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A
woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved.” “All this she must possess,” added Darcy,
“and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the
improvement of her mind by extensive reading.” “I am no longer surprised
at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your
knowing any.” “Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the
possibility of all this?” “I never saw such a woman, I never saw such
capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe,
united.” Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the
injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew
many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to
order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going
forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon
afterwards left the room. “Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the
door was closed on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to
recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and
with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a
paltry device, a very mean art.” “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom
this remark was chiefly addressed, “there is meanness in all the arts
which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever
bears affinity to cunning is despicable.” Miss Bingley was not so
entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. Elizabeth
joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she
could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
ELIZABETH PASSED THE chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a
house-maid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who
waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she
requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit
Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. The note was
immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.
Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield
soon after the family breakfast. Had she found Jane in any apparent
danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied
on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her
recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably
remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen therefore to her
daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary,
who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After
sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley’s appearance and
invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the
breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not
found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. “Indeed I have, Sir,” was her
answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must
not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your
kindness.” “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My
sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.” “You may depend upon
it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, “that Miss Bennet
shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.”
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. “I am sure,” she added,
“if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of
her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with
the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her,
for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I
often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room
here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. I do
not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will
not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short
lease.” “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore
if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in
five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed
here.” “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said
Elizabeth. “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning
towards her. “Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.” “I wish I might take
this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is
pitiful.” “That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a
deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as
yours.” “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not
run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.” “I did
not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study.” “Yes; but intricate
characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage.”
“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.” “But people themselves alter so much, that there is
something new to be observed in them for ever.” “Yes, indeed,” cried
Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country
neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in
the country as in town.” Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after
looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who
fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her
triumph. “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the
country for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is
a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?” “When I am in the
country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town
it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can
be equally happy in either.” “Aye—that is because you have the right
disposition. But that gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the
country was nothing at all.” “Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,” said
Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He
only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with
in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.”
“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.”
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away. “Yes, she
called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is,
Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so
easy!—He has always something to say to every body.—That is my idea of
good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and
never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.” “Did Charlotte dine
with you?” “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the
mince pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do
their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. But every body
is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend.” “She
seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley. “Oh! dear, yes;—but
you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so,
and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but
to be sure, Jane—one does not often see any body better looking. It is
what every body says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was
only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town, so
much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her
an offer before we came away. But however he did not. Perhaps he thought
her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty
they were.” “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently.
“There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder
who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!” “I
have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said Darcy. “Of
a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is strong
already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am
convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.” Darcy only
smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest
her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but
could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet
began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with
an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield. Lydia was a stout,
well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured
countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought
her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort
of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to
whom her uncle’s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her,
had increased into assurance. She was very equal therefore to address
Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his
promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world
if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful
to their mother’s ear. “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my
engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please
name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing
while she is ill.” Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would
be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely
Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your
ball,” she added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell
Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.” Mrs. Bennet
and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to
Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the remarks of the
two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be
prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss
Bingley’s witticisms on fine eyes. THE DAY PASSED much as the day before
had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the
morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in
the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo
table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley,
seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly
calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and
Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each. “How delighted Miss Darcy
will be to receive such a letter!” He made no answer. “You write
uncommonly fast.” “You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.” “How many
letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year!
Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!” “It is
fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.” “Pray
tell your sister that I long to see her.” “I have already told her so
once, by your desire.” “I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me
mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.” “Thank you—but I always
mend my own.” “How can you contrive to write so even?” He was silent.
“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley’s.” “Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write
again?—At present I have not room to do them justice.” “Oh! it is of no
consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such
charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?” “They are generally long; but
whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.” “It is a rule
with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot
write ill.” “That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,”
cried her brother—“because he does not write with ease. He studies too
much for words of four syllables.—Do not you, Darcy?” “My stile of
writing is very different from yours.” “Oh!” cried Miss Bingley,
“Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half
his words, and blots the rest.” “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have
not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no
ideas at all to my correspondents.” “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said
Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.” “Nothing is more deceitful,” said
Darcy, “than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness
of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.” “And which of the two do
you call my little recent piece of modesty?” “The indirect boast;—for
you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider
them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of
execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly
interesting. The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much
prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the
imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning
that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in
five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to
yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which
must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real
advantage to yourself or any one else?” “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is
too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in
the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself
to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did
not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off
before the ladies.” “I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means
convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would
be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as
you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had
better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would
probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month.” “You have
only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did not do
justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much more
than he did himself.” “I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by
your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness
of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that
gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the
better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial,
and ride off as fast as I could.” “Would Mr. Darcy then consider the
rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in
adhering to it?” “Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter,
Darcy must speak for himself.” “You expect me to account for opinions
which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation,
you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to
desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely
desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its
propriety.” “To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no
merit with you.” “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the
understanding of either.” “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing
for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the
requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without
waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly
speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may
as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss
the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary
cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the
other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think
ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be
argued into it?” “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this
subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance
which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy
subsisting between the parties?” “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us
hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and
size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than
you may be aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great
tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so
much deference. I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy,
on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house
especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do.”
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense. “I see your design, Bingley,” said
his friend.—“You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.”
“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.” “What you ask,”
said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much
better finish his letter.” Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his
letter. When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and
Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with
alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth
would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly
negatived, she seated herself. Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and
while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she
turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently
Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that
she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he
should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She
could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because
there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according
to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition
did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her— “Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss
Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?” She smiled, but
made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her
silence. “Oh!” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not
immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to
say ‘Yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste, but I
always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a
person of their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind
to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise
me if you dare.” “Indeed I do not dare.” Elizabeth, having rather
expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a
mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult
for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any
woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the
inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger. Miss
Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety
for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from
her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth. She often tried to provoke Darcy
into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and
planning his happiness in such an alliance. “I hope,” said she, as they
were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, “you will give your
mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to
the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure
the younger girls of running after the officers.—And, if I may mention
so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,
bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.” “Have
you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?” “Oh! yes.—Do
let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the
gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle the judge. They
are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for
your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?” “It would not be
easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and
the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.” At that moment
they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself. “I
did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard. “You used us abominably ill,”
answered Mrs. Hurst, “in running away without telling us that you were
coming out.” Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left
Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy
felt their rudeness and immediately said,— “This walk is not wide enough
for our party. We had better go into the avenue.” But Elizabeth who had
not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, “No,
no; stay where you are.—You are charmingly group’d, and appear to
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good bye.” She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled
about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was
already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of
hours that evening. WHEN THE LADIES removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran
up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her
into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with
many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so
agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen
appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could
describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour,
and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. But when the gentlemen
entered, Jane was no longer the first object. Miss Bingley’s eyes were
instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him
before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss
Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight
bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained
for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first
half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from
the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of
the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door. He then sat
down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else. Elizabeth, at work in
the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. When tea was over,
Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain. She
had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards;
and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured
him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on
the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to
do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. Darcy
took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally
occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in
her brother’s conversation with Miss Bennet. Miss Bingley’s attention
was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy’s progress through his
book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some
inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any
conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length,
quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she
had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a
great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this
way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much
sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!—When I have a house of my
own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” No one
made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast
her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her
brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards
him and said, “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating
a dance at Netherfield?—I would advise you, before you determine on it,
to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there
are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.” “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if
he chuses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send
round my cards.” “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied,
“if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something
insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would
surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the
order of the day.” “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say,
but it would not be near so much like a ball.” Miss Bingley made no
answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. Her figure
was elegant, and she walked well;—but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed,
was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings she
resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said, “Miss
Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn
about the room.—I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long
in one attitude.” Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility;
Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in
that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his
book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it,
observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to
walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his
joining them would interfere. “What could he mean? she was dying to know
what could be his meaning”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all
understand him? “Not at all,” was her answer, “but depend upon it, he
means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will
be to ask nothing about it.” Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of
disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in
requiring an explanation of his two motives. “I have not the smallest
objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon as she allowed him to
speak. “You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you
are in each other’s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or
because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest
advantage in walking;—if the first, I should be completely in your
way;—and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the
fire.” “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard any thing so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?” “Nothing so
easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We can all
plague and punish one another. Teaze him—laugh at him.—Intimate as you
are, you must know how it is to be done.” “But upon my honour I do not.
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Teaze
calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no—I feel he may defy us
there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please,
by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”
“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a
laugh.” “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can
be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their
actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke.” “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people,
but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or
good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I
own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.—But these, I suppose, are
precisely what you are without.” “Perhaps that is not possible for any
one. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses
which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.” “Such as vanity
and pride.” “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is
a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. “Your examination of Mr. Darcy is
over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;—“and pray what is the result?” “I
am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.” “No”—said Darcy, “I have made no such
pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of
understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for.—It is I believe too
little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I
cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor
their offences against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with
every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called
resentful.—My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.” “That is a
failing indeed!”—cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment is a shade in a
character. But you have chosen your fault well.—I really cannot laugh at
it. You are safe from me.” “There is, I believe, in every disposition a
tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the
best education can overcome.” “And your defect is a propensity to hate
every body.” “And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is wilfully to
misunderstand them.” “Do let us have a little music,”—cried Miss
Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.—“Louisa, you
will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst.” Her sister made not the smallest
objection, and the pianoforte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments
recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of
paying Elizabeth too much attention. IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN agreement
between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to
beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.
But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at
Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish
Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure
before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to
Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent
them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday;
and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister
pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.—Against
staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she
much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being
considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to
borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled
that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be
mentioned, and the request made. The communication excited many
professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at
least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their
going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed
the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her
affection for the other. The master of the house heard with real sorrow
that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss
Bennet that it would not be safe for her—that she was not enough
recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. To
Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield
long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was
uncivil to her, and more teazing than usual to himself. He wisely
resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should
now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her. On Sunday,
after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took
place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very
rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after
assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her
either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she
even shook hands with the former.—Elizabeth took leave of the whole
party in the liveliest spirits. They were not welcomed home very
cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and
thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would
have caught cold again.—But their father, though very laconic in his
expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their
importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they
were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its
sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth. They found Mary, as usual,
deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new
extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to
listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different
sort. Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since
the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with
their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted
that Colonel Forster was going to be married. IHOPE, MY DEAR,” said
Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning,
“that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to
expect an addition to our family party.” “Who do you mean, my dear? I
know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should
happen to call in, and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do
not believe she often sees such at home.” “The person of whom I speak,
is a gentleman and a stranger.” Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled.—“A
gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure. Why Jane—you
never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be
extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.—But—good lord! how unlucky! there is
not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I
must speak to Hill, this moment.” “It is not Mr. Bingley,” said her
husband; “it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my
life.” This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of
being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once. After
amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.
“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.” “Oh! my
dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do
not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the
world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children;
and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do
something or other about it.” Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to
her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted it before, but it
was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and
she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate
away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody
cared anything about. “It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said
Mr. Bennet, “and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of
inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may
perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.” “No,
that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him
to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?” “Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial
scruples on that head, as you will hear.” Hunsford, near Westerham,
Kent, 15th October. Dear Sir, THE disagreement subsisting between
yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness,
and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently
wished to heal the breach but for some time I was kept back by my own
doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to
be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be
at variance.—“There, Mrs. Bennet.”—My mind however is now made up on the
subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so
fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose
bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this
parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with
grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform
those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of
England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and
establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my
influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present
overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance
of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly
overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive
branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of
injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as
well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends,—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’night
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your well-wisher and friend, William Collins. “At four
o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said
Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.” “There is some sense in what
he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any
amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.” “Though it is
difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to make us the
atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.”
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required. “He must be an oddity, I
think,” said she. “I cannot make him out.—There is something very
pompous in his stile.—And what can he mean by apologizing for being next
in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.—Can he
be a sensible man, sir?” “No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes
of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and
self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to
see him.” “In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not
seem defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new,
yet I think it is well expressed.” To Catherine and Lydia, neither the
letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to
impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was
now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a
man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had
done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a
degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,
“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.” “You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.” “Ah! sir, I
do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.
Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all
chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once
they come to be entailed.” “I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship
to my fair cousins,—and could say much on the subject, but that I am
cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the
young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not
say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted—” He was interrupted
by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were
not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The hall, the
dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his
commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but
for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future
property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged
to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was
owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with
some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and
that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon
for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not
at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an
hour. DURING DINNER, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the
servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation
with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him
to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.
Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration
for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have
chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject
elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most
important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed
such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as
he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously
pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the
honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at
Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her
pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by
many people he knew, but he had never seen any thing but affability in
her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman;
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets up stairs. “That is
all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I dare say
she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general
are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?” “The garden in
which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings
Park, her ladyship’s residence.” “I think you said she was a widow, sir?
has she any family?” “She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings,
and of very extensive property.” “Ah!” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her
head, “then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young
lady is she? is she handsome?” “She is a most charming young lady
indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss
de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is
that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her
making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not
otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended
her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly
amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little
phaeton and ponies.” “Has she been presented? I do not remember her name
among the ladies at court.” “Her indifferent state of health unhappily
prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine
myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest
ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine
that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate
compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once
observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be
a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her
consequence, would be adorned by her.—These are the kind of little
things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I
conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.” “You judge very properly,”
said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of
flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions
proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous
study?” “They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though
I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little
elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always
wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.” Mr. Bennet’s
expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had
hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at
the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in
an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.—Kitty stared at him, and
Lydia exclaimed.—Other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with, “Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of
turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My
aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton tomorrow to
hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but
Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, “I have often
observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious
stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I
confess;—for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as
instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.” Then
turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia’s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon. MR. COLLINS WAS not a sensible man, and the deficiency
of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the
greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an
illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the
universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at
it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had
brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but
it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head,
living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and
unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the
respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as
his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his
authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him
altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and
humility. Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he
intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn
family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters,
if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by
common report. This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting
their father’s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of
eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested
on his own part. His plan did not vary on seeing them.—Miss Bennet’s
lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest
notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was
his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for
in a quarter of an hour’s tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast,
a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.—“As to
her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say—she could not
positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession;—her eldest
daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint,
was likely to be very soon engaged.” Mr. Collins had only to change from
Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was
stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty,
succeeded her of course. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted
that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she
could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good
graces. Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every
sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend
them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of
him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had
followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally
engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really
talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at
Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library
he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though
prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every
other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his
civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his
daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better
fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close
his large book, and go. In pompous nothings on his side, and civil
assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered
Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be
gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in
quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed,
or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them. But the
attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had
never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an
officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very
Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air,
all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.
What could be the meaning of it?—It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know. In another minute Mr. Bingley, but
without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with
his friend. Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to
the door of Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of
Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in
spite of Mrs. Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly
seconding the invitation. Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her
nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly
welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden
return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she
should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see
Mr. Jones’s shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not
to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were
come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s
introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness,
which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion,
without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help
flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the
young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite
awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one
stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the
other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they
already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he
was to have a lieutenant’s commission in the——shire. She had been
watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the
street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly
have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows
now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger,
were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine
with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her
husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the
family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and
Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy
game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The
prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual
good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room,
and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly
needless. As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had
seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended
either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly
gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips’s manners and politeness.
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never
seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the
utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation
for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something
he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he
had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. AS
NO OBJECTION was made to the young people’s engagement with their aunt,
and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a
single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
the house. When this information was given, and they had all taken their
seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he
was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he
declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer
breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey
much gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper’s room. In describing to her all the grandeur of
Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of
his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was
happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in
Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence
increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all
among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not
listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an
instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the
mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at
last however. The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked
into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him
before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of
unreasonable admiration. The officers of the——shire were in general a
very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the
present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person,
countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced
stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the
room. Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye
was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker. With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as
Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into
insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had
still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her
watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the
card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in
return, by sitting down to whist. “I know little of the game, at
present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my
situation of life”—Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance,
but could not wait for his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist,
and with ready delight was he received at the other table between
Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing
him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise
extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in
the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have
attention for any one in particular. Allowing for the common demands of
the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and
she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear
she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with
Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity
however was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject
himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after
receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy
had been staying there. “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then,
unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “he is a man of very large
property in Derbyshire, I understand.” “Yes,” replied Wickham;—“his
estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could
not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain
information on that head than myself—for I have been connected with his
family in a particular manner from my infancy.” Elizabeth could not but
look surprised. “You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an
assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of
our meeting yesterday.—Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?” “As much
as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth warmly,—“I have spent four days
in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.” “I have
no right to give my opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being agreeable
or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long
and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be
impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere
else.—Here you are in your own family.” “Upon my word I say no more here
than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with
his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.”
“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short
interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.”
“I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head. “I wonder,” said he, at
the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this
country much longer.” “I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his
going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of
the——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.” “Oh!
no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to
avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always
gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but
what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage,
and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss
Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,
and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with
this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender
recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily
believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his
disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.”
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry. “It was the prospect of constant society,
and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter
the——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my
friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present
quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance
Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have
been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must
have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended
for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to
have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at
this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it
pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.” “Indeed!” “Yes—the
late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in
his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot
do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and
thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.” “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could that be?—How
could his will be disregarded?—Why did not you seek legal redress?”
“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too
freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me.” “This is quite
shocking!—He deserves to be publicly disgraced.” “Some time or other he
will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can
never defy or expose him.” Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and
thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. “But what,” said
she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?—what can have induced him
to behave so cruelly?” “A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike
which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late
Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but
his father’s uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very
early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in
which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me.” “I had
not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him, I
had not thought so very ill of him—I had supposed him to be despising
his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending
to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!”
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, “I do remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must
be dreadful.” “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham,
“I can hardly be just to him.” Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and
after a time exclaimed, “To treat in such a manner, the godson, the
friend, the favourite of his father!”—She could have added, “A young man
too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being
amiable”—but she contented herself with “And one, too, who had probably
been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think
you said, in the closest manner!” “We were born in the same parish,
within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed
together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements,
objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the
profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit
to—but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and
devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most
highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.
Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest
obligations to my father’s active superintendance, and when immediately
before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of
providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of
gratitude to him, as of affection to myself.” “How strange!” cried
Elizabeth. “How abominable!—I wonder that the very pride of this
Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!—If from no better motive, that
he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,—for dishonesty I must
call it.” “It is wonderful,”—replied Wickham,—“for almost all his
actions may be traced to pride;—and pride has often been his best
friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were
stronger impulses even than pride.” “Can such abominable pride as his,
have ever done him good?” “Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and
generous,—to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist
his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride, for
he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. Not to appear
to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or
lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has
also brotherly pride, which with some brotherly affection, makes him a
very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him
generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.” “What
sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?” He shook his head.—“I wish I could call
her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too
much like her brother,—very, very proud.—As a child, she was
affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted
hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a
handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly
accomplished. Since her father’s death, her home has been London, where
a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.” After many
pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help
reverting once more to the first, and saying, “I am astonished at his
intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour
itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with
such a man? How can they suit each other?—Do you know Mr. Bingley?” “Not
at all.” “He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know
what Mr. Darcy is.” “Probably not;—but Mr. Darcy can please where he
chuses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if
he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in
consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less
prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is
liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps
agreeable,—allowing something for fortune and figure.” The whist party
soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table,
and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and
Mrs. Philips.—The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the
latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when
Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with
much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he
considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make
herself uneasy. “I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons
sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these
things,—and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five
shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the
same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond
the necessity of regarding little matters.” Mr. Wickham’s attention was
caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked
Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately
acquainted with the family of De Bourgh. “Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she
replied, “has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how
Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not
known her long.” “You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and
Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the
present Mr. Darcy.” “No, indeed, I did not.—I knew nothing at all of
Lady Catherine’s connections. I never heard of her existence till the
day before yesterday.” “Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very
large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the
two estates.” This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of
poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and
useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he
were already self-destined to another. “Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks
highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some
particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude
misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an
arrogant, conceited woman.” “I believe her to be both in a great
degree,” replied Wickham; “I have not seen her for many years, but I
very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were
dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably
sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her
abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,
and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one
connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.”
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of
Mr. Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House. ELIZABETH RELATED TO
Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane
listened with astonishment and concern;—she knew not how to believe that
Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was
not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such
amiable appearance as Wickham.—The possibility of his having really
endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;
and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them
both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of
accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained. “They
have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other,
of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.” “Very true, indeed;—and now, my
dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people
who have probably been concerned in the business?—Do clear them too, or
we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.” “Laugh as much as you
chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do
but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be
treating his father’s favourite in such a manner,—one, whom his father
had promised to provide for.—It is impossible. No man of common
humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable
of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?
oh! no.” “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on,
than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave
me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.—If
it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in
his looks.” “It is difficult indeed—it is distressing.—One does not know
what to think.” “I beg your pardon;—one knows exactly what to think.”
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,—that Mr. Bingley,
if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public. The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery
where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very
persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came
to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at
Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies
were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since
they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself
since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little
attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to
Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again;
rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by
surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s
civilities. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable
to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given
in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with
Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy’s
looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with
Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them,
and a ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her
family that she had no disinclination for it. “While, I can have my
mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough.—I think it no sacrifice to
join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all;
and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation
and amusement as desirable for every body.” Elizabeth’s spirits were so
high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily
to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to
accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think
it proper to join in the evening’s amusement; and she was rather
surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head,
and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or
Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance. “I am by no means of
opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of this kind, given by a
young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil
tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall
hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course
of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss
Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,—a preference which I
trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any
disrespect for her.” Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had
fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:—and to
have Mr. Collins instead!—her liveliness had been never worse timed.
There was no help for it however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own
was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal
accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better
pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something
more.—It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her
sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of
assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more
eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed
his increasing civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent
attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more
astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was
not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability
of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. Elizabeth however
did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute
must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the
offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. If there
had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger
Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from
the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a
succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt,
no officers, no news could be sought after;—the very shoe-roses for
Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia. TILL ELIZABETH ENTERED the
drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the
cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had
never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked
by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed
her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the
highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his
heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of
the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being
purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation
to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute
fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom
Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged
to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;
adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business would
have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain
gentleman here.” This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia,
was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less
answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been
just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened
by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable
civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached
to make.—Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though
every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not
dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte
Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a
voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out
to her particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a
return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins,
awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving
wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which
a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of
her release from him was exstacy. She danced next with an officer, and
had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was
universally liked. When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte
Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly
addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his
application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she
accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret
over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.
“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.” “Heaven forbid!—That
would be the greatest misfortune of all!—To find a man agreeable whom
one is determined to hate!—Do not wish me such an evil.” When the
dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand,
Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was silent again.
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with. “It
is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.—I talked about the dance,
and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or
the number of couples.” He smiled, and assured her that whatever she
wished him to say should be said. “Very well.—That reply will do for the
present.—Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much
pleasanter than public ones.—But now we may be silent.” “Do you talk by
rule then, while you are dancing?” “Sometimes. One must speak a little,
you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour
together, and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so
arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as
possible.” “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or
do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?” “Both,” replied Elizabeth
archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our
minds.—We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to
speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room,
and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.” “This
is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,” said
he. “How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say.—You think it a
faithful portrait undoubtedly.” “I must not decide on my own
performance.” He made no answer, and they were again silent till they
had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did
not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,
unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other
day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.” The effect was
immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he
said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own
weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained
manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may
ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining
them, is less certain.” “He has been so unlucky as to lose your
friendship,” replied Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he
is likely to suffer from all his life.” Darcy made no answer, and seemed
desirous of changing the subject. At that moment Sir William Lucas
appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other
side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of
superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner. “I
have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very superior
dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first
circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing
at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will
then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you,
Sir.—You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of.” “I do not think we were speaking at
all. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room
who had less to say for themselves.—We have tried two or three subjects
already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot
imagine.” “What think you of books?” said he, smiling. “Books—Oh! no.—I
am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.” “I am
sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no
want of subject.—We may compare our different opinions.” “No—I cannot
talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.”
“The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said he, with
a look of doubt. “Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she
said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon
afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you
once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment
once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to
its being created.” “I am,” said he, with a firm voice. “And never allow
yourself to be blinded by prejudice?” “I hope not.” “It is particularly
incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of
judging properly at first.” “May I ask to what these questions tend?”
“Merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.” “And what is
your success?” She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such
different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.” “I can readily
believe,” answered he gravely, “that report may vary greatly with
respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to
sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear
that the performance would reflect no credit on either.” “But if I do
not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.” “I
would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied. She
said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence;
on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy’s
breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon
procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another. They
had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an
expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, “So, Miss Eliza, I hear
you are quite delighted with George Wickham!—Your sister has been
talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find
that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications,
that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me
recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to
all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly
false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him,
though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I
do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not
in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham
mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid
including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad
to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the
country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he
could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of
your favourite’s guilt, but really considering his descent, one could
not expect much better.” “His guilt and his descent appear by your
account to be the same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you
accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s
steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.” “I beg
your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. “Excuse
my interference.—It was kindly meant.” “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth
to herself.—“You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such
a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful
ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her eldest
sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of
Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of
such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied
with the occurrences of the evening.—Elizabeth instantly read her
feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against
his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane’s
being in the fairest way for happiness. “I want to know,” said she, with
a countenance no less smiling than her sister’s, “what you have learnt
about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to
think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.”
“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s
regard.” “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?” “No; he never
saw him till the other morning at Meryton.” “This account then is what
he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am perfectly satisfied. But what does
he say of the living?” “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances,
though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes
that it was left to him conditionally only.” “I have not a doubt of
Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly; “but you must excuse my
not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley’s defence of his
friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with
several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend
himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did
before.” She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,
and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth
listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane
entertained of Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten
her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself,
Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the
pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before
Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he
had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. “I
have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in
the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
have thought of my meeting with—perhaps—a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly!—I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.” “You are not going
to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?” “Indeed I am. I shall intreat his
pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady
Catherine’s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her
ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.” Elizabeth tried hard to
dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would
consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent
freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the
least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if
it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to
begin the acquaintance.—Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined
air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking,
replied thus, “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the
world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”
“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.”—It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth. “I have no reason, I assure
you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed
much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost
civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well
convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could
never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought.
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.” As Elizabeth had no longer
any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost
entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable
reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps
almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house
in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and
she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like
Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent
the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might
hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered
it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each
other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to
that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of
her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.—It was
an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while
enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young
man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first
points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how
fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must
desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a
promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly
must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so
pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters
to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into
company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance
a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but
no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at
home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that
Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and
triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. In vain did Elizabeth
endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s words, or persuade her
to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her
inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was
overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only
scolded her for being nonsensical. “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that
I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular
civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.” “For
heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower.—What advantage can it be to you to
offend Mr. Darcy?—You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so
doing.” Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her
mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth
blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help
frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced
her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her
mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by
her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant
contempt to a composed and steady gravity. At length however Mrs. Bennet
had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the
repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left
to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive.
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over,
singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary,
after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many
significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent
such a proof of complaisance,—but in vain; Mary would not understand
them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she
began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her with most painful
sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas
with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary,
on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that
she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half
a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a
display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.—Elizabeth was in
agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very
composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw
them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued
however impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit.” Mary, though pretending not to hear,
was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for
her father’s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.—Others of
the party were now applied to. “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so
fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am
sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a
very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of
a clergyman.—I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in
devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other
things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do.—In the
first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be
beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his
own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his
parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he
cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not
think it of light importance that he should have attentive and
conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to
whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could
I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his
respect towards any body connected with the family.” And with a bow to
Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to
be heard by half the room.—Many stared.—Many smiled; but no one looked
more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended
Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a
half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind
of young man. To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an
agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening,
it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more
spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her
sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. The rest of
the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by Mr. Collins,
who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not
prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to
dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody
else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He
assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that
his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her,
and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the
whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her
greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
goodnaturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself. She was at
least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s farther notice; though often
standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never
came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of
her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it. The Longbourn party
were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of
Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after
every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they
were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister
scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were
evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every
attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor
over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,
how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn. When at length they
arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope
of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself
particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them,
by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of
a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily
engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his
return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a
short time. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house
under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary
preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she
should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the
course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to
Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable,
though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all
her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough
for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
THE NEXT DAY opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, “May I hope,
Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I
solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of
this morning?” Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of
surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered, “Oh dear!—Yes—certainly.—I am
sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection.—Come,
Kitty, I want you up stairs.” And gathering her work together, she was
hastening away, when Elizabeth called out, “Dear Ma’am, do not go.—I beg
you will not go.—Mr. Collins must excuse me.—He can have nothing to say
to me that any body need not hear. I am going away myself.” “No, no,
nonsense, Lizzy.—I desire you will stay where you are.”—And upon
Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added, “Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing
Mr. Collins.” Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a
moment’s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest
to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again,
and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were
divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked
off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began. “Believe me, my
dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any
disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been
less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness;
but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother’s
permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my
discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my
attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I
entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it
will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and moreover
for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I
certainly did.” The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure,
being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing
that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop
him farther, and he continued: “My reasons for marrying are, first, that
I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like
myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I
am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which
perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular
advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour
of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion
(unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night
before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while
Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh’s foot-stool, that she said,
‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.—Chuse
properly, chuse a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be
an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make
a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as
soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me,
by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for
several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter
myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for
me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my
affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no
demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it
could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per
cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s decease, is all
that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be
uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous
reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.” It was absolutely
necessary to interrupt him now. “You are too hasty, Sir,” she cried.
“You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without farther
loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I
am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible
for me to do otherwise than decline them.” “I am not now to learn,”
replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, “that it is usual
with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly
mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that
sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I am
therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall
hope to lead you to the altar ere long.” “Upon my word, Sir,” cried
Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my
declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if
such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their
happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly
serious in my refusal.—You could not make me happy, and I am convinced
that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so.—Nay, were
your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me
in every respect ill qualified for the situation.” “Were it certain that
Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins very gravely—“but I
cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you
may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall
speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable
qualifications.” “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be
unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the
compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich,
and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being
otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy
of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of
Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self reproach. This
matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as
she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins
thus addressed her, “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next
on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than
you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at
present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to
reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now
said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true
delicacy of the female character.” “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried
Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have
hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not
how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being
one.” “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that
your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:—It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be
any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.” “I do
assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of
elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather
be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and
again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept
them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it.
Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female
intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth
from her heart.” “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of
awkward gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the
express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not
fail of being acceptable.” To such perseverance in wilful self-deception
Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;
determined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as
flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might
be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at
least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an
elegant female. MR. COLLINS WAS NOT left long to the silent
contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled
about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner
saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the
staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both
him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer
connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with
equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their
interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be
satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had stedfastly given him
would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy
of her character. This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;—she
would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant
to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not
to believe it, and could not help saying so. “But depend upon it,
Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will
speak to her about it myself directly. She is a very headstrong foolish
girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will make her know it.”
“Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.” “Sir, you quite
misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is only headstrong
in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as good natured a
girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very
soon settle it with her, I am sure.” She would not give him time to
reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered
the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in
an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows
she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his
mind and not have her.” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she
entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not
in the least altered by her communication. “I have not the pleasure of
understanding you,” said he, when she had finished her speech. “Of what
are you talking?” “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not
have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have
Lizzy.” “And what am I to do on the occasion?—It seems an hopeless
business.” “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist
upon her marrying him.” “Let her be called down. She shall hear my
opinion.” Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to
the library. “Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I
have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that
Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth
replied that it was. “Very well—and this offer of marriage you have
refused?” “I have, Sir.” “Very well. We now come to the point. Your
mother insists upon your accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?” “Yes,
or I will never see her again.” “An unhappy alternative is before you,
Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your
parents.—Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry
Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.” Elizabeth could
not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet,
who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she
wished, was excessively disappointed. “What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by
talking in this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him.”
“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.” Not yet, however, in spite of her
disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She
talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all
possible mildness declined interfering;—and Elizabeth sometimes with
real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her
attacks. Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret. While
the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day
with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her,
cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such fun
here!—What do you think has happened this morning?—Mr. Collins has made
an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.” Charlotte had hardly time
to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same
news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where
Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling
on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her
friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. “Pray do, my
dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on my
side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my
poor nerves.” Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and
Elizabeth. “Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as
unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at
York, provided she can have her own way.—But I tell you what, Miss
Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of
marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure
I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.—I shall
not be able to keep you—and so I warn you.—I have done with you from
this very day.—I told you in the library, you know, that I should never
speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no
pleasure in talking to undutiful children.—Not that I have much pleasure
indeed in talking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous
complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell
what I suffer!—But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never
pitied.” Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible
that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more
stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls. “Now,
I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let
Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.” Elizabeth
passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood
her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained
first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and
all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity,
satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.
In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
conversation.—“Oh! Mr. Collins!”— “My dear Madam,” replied he, “let us
be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me,” he presently
continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, “to resent the
behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty
of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as
I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not
the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair
cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that
resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to
lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope,
consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by
thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without
having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to
interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may I fear be
objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter’s lips
instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly
meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an
amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage
of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I
here beg leave to apologise.” THE DISCUSSION OF Mr. Collins’s offer was
now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the
uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from
some peevish allusion of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his
feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or
by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful
silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions
which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest
of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a
seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend. The morrow
produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill health.
Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had
hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not
appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay. After breakfast, the
girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to
lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on
their entering the town and attended them to their aunt’s, where his
regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked
over.—To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the
necessity of his absence had been self imposed. “I found,” said he, “as
the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;—that to be in
the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might
be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to
more than myself.” She highly approved his forbearance, and they had
leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which
they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer
walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly
attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt
all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as
an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. Soon after
their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from
Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet
of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair,
flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she
read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane
recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join
with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth
felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from
Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a
glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had
gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said, “This is from
Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal. The
whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to
town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear
what she says.” She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised
the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to
town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in
Grosvenor-street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these
words. “I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in
Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope
at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful
intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of
separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I
depend on you for that.” To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth
listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the
suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really
to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield
would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their
society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in
the enjoyment of his. “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause,
“that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the
country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to
which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware,
and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be
renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?—Mr. Bingley will not
be detained in London by them.” “Caroline decidedly says that none of
the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to
you”— “When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business
which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but
as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that
when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we
have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to
spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance
are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of
that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three, of whom we shall deprive you.” “It is evident by this,” added
Jane, “that he comes back no more this winter.” “It is only evident that
Miss Bingley does not mean he should.” “Why will you think so? It must
be his own doing.—He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will
read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no
reserves from you.” “Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to
confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I
really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,
and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and
myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the
hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not
know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject,
but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you
will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly
already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most
intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his
own, and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I
call Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these
circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I
wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will
secure the happiness of so many?” “What think you of this sentence, my
dear Lizzy?”—said Jane as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough?—Does
it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to
be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s
indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for
him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any
other opinion on the subject?” “Yes, there can; for mine is totally
different.—Will you hear it?” “Most willingly.” “You shall have it in
few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and
wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in the hope of
keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about
you.” Jane shook her head. “Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.—No
one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection. Miss
Bingley I am sure cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have
seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered
her wedding clothes. But the case is this. We are not rich enough, or
grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for
her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage,
she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is
certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de
Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously
imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires
Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit
than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her
power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very
much in love with her friend.” “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,”
replied Jane, “your representation of all this, might make me quite
easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of
wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is,
that she is deceived herself.” “That is right.—You could not have
started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.
Believe her to be deceived by all means. You have now done your duty by
her, and must fret no longer.” “But, my dear sister, can I be happy,
even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends
are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?” “You must decide for yourself,”
said Elizabeth, “and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the
misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the
happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.”
“How can you talk so?”—said Jane faintly smiling,—“you must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.” “I did not think you would;—and that being the case, I
cannot consider your situation with much compassion.” “But if he returns
no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things
may arise in six months!” The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth
treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the
suggestion of Caroline’s interested wishes, and she could not for a
moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,
could influence a young man so totally independent of every one. She
represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the
subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane’s
temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the
diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would
return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. They agreed
that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family,
without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct; but even
this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she
bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go
away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses. THE BENNETS WERE engaged to dine with the Lucases, and
again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen
to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps
him in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can
express.” Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being
useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her
time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther
than Elizabeth had any conception of;—its object was nothing less, than
to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging
them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were
so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His
reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. In as short a
time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow, every thing was settled
between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house,
he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the
happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the
present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The
stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship
from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and
Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested
desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were
gained. Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their
consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s
present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter,
to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future
wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate
with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many
years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as
his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession
of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and
his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole family
in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls
formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might
otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension
of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably
composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her
reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was
neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his
attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her
husband.—Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage
had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for
well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of
giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This
preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven,
without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The
least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must
occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of
any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her;
and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be
hurt by such disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information
herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn
to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could
not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long
absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as
required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising
great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. As
he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them. “My dear Madam,” he
replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what
I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall
avail myself of it as soon as possible.” They were all astonished; and
Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return,
immediately said, “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s
disapprobation here, my good sir?—You had better neglect your relations,
than run the risk of offending your patroness.” “My dear sir,” replied
Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly
caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step
without her ladyship’s concurrence.” “You cannot be too much on your
guard. Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it
likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think
exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we
shall take no offence.” “Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly
excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will
speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for
every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for
my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it
necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and
happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.” With proper civilities
the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he
meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he
thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary
might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much
higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections
which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself she
thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an
example as her’s, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the
following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas
called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth
related the event of the day before. The possibility of Mr. Collins’s
fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth
within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him,
seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him
herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome
at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,
“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,—impossible!” The steady
countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave
way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach;
though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her
composure, and calmly replied, “Why should you be surprised, my dear
Eliza?—Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to
procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to
succeed with you?” But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making
a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness
that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and
that she wished her all imaginable happiness. “I see what you are
feeling,” replied Charlotte,—“you must be surprised, very much
surprised,—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when
you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied
with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I never was. I ask
only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character,
connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of
happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the
marriage state.” Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;”—and after an
awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did
not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she
had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the
idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making
two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of
his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of
matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed
it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed
every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of
Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture!—And to the pang of a friend
disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing
conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy
in the lot she had chosen. ELIZABETH WAS SITTING with her mother and
sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were
authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent
by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. With many
compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a
connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,—to an audience
not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more
perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken,
and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,
“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?—Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?” Nothing less than the
complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such
treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding carried him through it all;
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his
information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most
forbearing courtesy. Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve
him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm
his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte
herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother
and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William,
in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of
remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the
excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of
Hunsford from London. Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to
say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left
them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she
persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was
very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly she trusted that
they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might
be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the
whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and
the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and
on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.
Nothing could console and nothing appease her.—Nor did that day wear out
her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter. Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much
more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he
pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he
said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think
tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than
his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match;
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for
their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as
improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for
Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way
than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton. Lady Lucas could not be
insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort
of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather
oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour
looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness
away. Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept
them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth’s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men. Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no
longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as
much disposed to complain of it as her husband.—It was very strange that
he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very
inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.—She hated having visitors in
the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all
people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of
Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of
Mr. Bingley’s continued absence. Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were
comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing
any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in
Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report
which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to
contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. Even Elizabeth began to
fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be
successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so
destructive of Jane’s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability
of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. The united
efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend,
assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London,
might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. As
for Jane, her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful
than Elizabeth’s; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing,
and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never
alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour
seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all
Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity. Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday
fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as
it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to
need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of
love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of
every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to
Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the
family went to bed. Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The
very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony
of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked
of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that
house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came
to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession;
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband. “Indeed, Mr. Bennet,”
said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be
mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and
live to see her take my place in it!” “My dear, do not give way to such
gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves
that I may be the survivor.” This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet,
and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, “I
cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail I should not mind it.” “What should not you mind?” “I
should not mind any thing at all.” “Let us be thankful that you are
preserved from a state of such insensibility.” “I never can be thankful,
Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail. How any one could have the
conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own daughters I cannot
understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!—Why should he have
it more than anybody else?” “I leave it to yourself to determine,” said
Mr. Bennet. MISS BINGLEY’S LETTER arrived, and put an end to doubt. The
very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in
London for the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not
having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire
before he left the country. Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane
could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the
professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss
Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again
dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy,
and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been
unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her
brother’s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with
raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline’s
assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he
had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded. A day or two passed before Jane had
courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on
Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than
usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, “Oh!
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea
of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will
not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be
as we were before.” Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous
solicitude, but said nothing. “You doubt me,” cried Jane slightly
colouring; “indeed you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the
most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing
either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I
have not that pain. A little time therefore.—I shall certainly try to
get the better.” With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this
comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on
my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself.” “My dear
Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness and
disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.”
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister’s warm affection. “Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this
is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt
if I speak ill of any body, I only want to think you perfect, and you
set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess,
of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will. You need
not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I
think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with
it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human
characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the
appearance of either merit or sense. I have met with two instances
lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is
unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!” “My dear Lizzy, do
not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness.
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.
Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and Charlotte’s prudent, steady
character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to
fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every
body’s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our
cousin.” “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no
one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I
persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think
worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane,
Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know
he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the
woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall
not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the
sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity,
nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence,
and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.” “I must think your
language too strong in speaking of both,” replied Jane, “and I hope you
will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. But enough of
this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I
cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me
by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is
sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and
circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives
us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.” “And men take care
that they should.” “If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified;
but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some
persons imagine.” “I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s
conduct to design,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong,
or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want
of resolution, will do the business.” “And do you impute it to either of
those?” “Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by
saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.” “You
persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.” “Yes, in
conjunction with his friend.” “I cannot believe it. Why should they try
to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is
attached to me, no other woman can secure it.” “Your first position is
false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish
his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a
girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.”
“Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;
“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken—or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.” Elizabeth
could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s name was
scarcely ever mentioned between them. Mrs. Bennet still continued to
wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom
passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed
little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her
daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe
herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a
common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but
though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she
had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best comfort was,
that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer. Mr. Bennet treated
the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day, “your sister is
crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a
girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. It is something
to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.
When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by
Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at Meryton to
disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man.
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.” “Thank you,
Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect
Jane’s good fortune.” “True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to
think that, whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an
affectionate mother who will always make the most of it.” Mr. Wickham’s
society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late
perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They
saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of
general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his
claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now
openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased
to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had
known any thing of the matter. Miss Bennet was the only creature who
could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case,
unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour
always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but
by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men. AFTER A
WEEK SPENT in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins
was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The
pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by
preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope,
that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be
fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks. On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure
of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the
Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man,
greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education. The
Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who
lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been
so well bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town. The first
part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival, was to distribute her
presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done, she had a
less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had
many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been
very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been
on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. “I do
not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if
she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she
might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it been for her
own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she
refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a
daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves.” Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been
given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with
her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces
turned the conversation. When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke
more on the subject. “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for
Jane,” said she. “I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so
often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in
love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates
them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very
frequent.” “An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but
it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.” “But that expression of ‘violently in
love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very
little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an
half-hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how
violent was Mr. Bingley’s love?” “I never saw a more promising
inclination. He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and
wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and
remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by
not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without
receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general
incivility the very essence of love?” “Oh, yes!—of that kind of love
which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her,
because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It
had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself
out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back
with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief
from home, may be as useful as anything.” Elizabeth was exceedingly
pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister’s ready
acquiescence. “I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with
regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a
part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well
know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet
at all, unless he really comes to see her.” “And that is quite
impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy
would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My
dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard
of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a
month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once
to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”
“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with the sister? She will not be able to help calling.” “She
will drop the acquaintance entirely.” But in spite of the certainty in
which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more
interesting one of Bingley’s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a
solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she
did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes
she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the
influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural
influence of Jane’s attractions. Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s
invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her
thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline’s not living
in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a
morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. The Gardiners staid
a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the
officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so
carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that
they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was
for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers
Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner,
rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm commendation of him, narrowly
observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be
very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough
to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on
the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the
imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham
had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general
powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had
spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he
belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though
Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, five
years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence
of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the
minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the
present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might
agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having
heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
ill-natured boy. MRS. GARDINER’S CAUTION to Elizabeth was punctually and
kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her
alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him;
he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought
to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is—you must
not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect
you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good
conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.” “My dear aunt,
this is being serious indeed.” “Yes, and I hope to engage you to be
serious likewise.” “Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will
take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love
with me, if I can prevent it.” “Elizabeth, you are not serious now.” “I
beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to
me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it.—Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy!—My father’s opinion of me does me
the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father,
however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be
very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we
see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom
withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements
with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my
fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would
be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be
in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will
do my best.” “Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming
here so very often. At least, you should not remind your Mother of
inviting him.” “As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a
conscious smile; “very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.
But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your
account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my
mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be
wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied.” Her aunt assured her that
she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints,
they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point,
without being resented. Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon
after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up
his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to
Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at
length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to
say in an ill-natured tone that she “wished they might be happy.”
Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her
farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of
her mother’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely
affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went down
stairs together, Charlotte said, “I shall depend on hearing from you
very often, Eliza.” “That you certainly shall.” “And I have another
favour to ask. Will you come and see me?” “We shall often meet, I hope,
in Hertfordshire.” “I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise
me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.” Elizabeth could not refuse, though
she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. “My father and Maria are to
come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I hope you will consent to
be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either
of them.” The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for
Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear
on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest. Jane had already written a
few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and
when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say
something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as
well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town,
without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,
however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn,
had by some accident been lost. “My aunt,” she continued, “is going
to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity
of calling in Grosvenor-street.” She wrote again when the visit was
paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. “I did not think Caroline in
spirits,” were her words, “but she was very glad to see me, and
reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was
right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her. I enquired after
their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with
Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was
expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as
Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall soon see them
here.” Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her, that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt. My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of
triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself
to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my
dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was,
my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all
comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the
same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived
again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note,
not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When she did come, it was
very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal,
apology for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me
again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she
went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no
longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in
singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to
intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that
she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for
her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and
though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it,
it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear
as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is
natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any
such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have
met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from
something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of
talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial
to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging
harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong
appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish
every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your
affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me
hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never
returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any
certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you
have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see
them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable
there. Your’s, &amp;C. This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her
spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped,
by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now
absolutely over. She would not even wish for any renewal of his
attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a
punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she
seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as, by
Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had
thrown away. Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her
promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and
Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt
than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions
were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful
enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without
material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity
was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice,
had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds
was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now
rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear sighted perhaps
in his case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish
of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and
while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish
her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both,
and could very sincerely wish him happy. All this was acknowledged to
Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went
on:—“I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in
love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I
should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even
impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all,
or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of
girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been
effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to
all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say
that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be
purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to
heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet
open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have
something to live on, as well as the plain.” WITH NO GREATER events than
these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little
beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did
January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but
Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually
learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater
certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again,
and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the
scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters,
home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its
own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in
short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any
delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled
according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William
and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London
was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. The
only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and
who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told
her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. The
farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his
side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her—their opinion of every body—would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him
with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing. Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to
make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter
Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing
to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as
much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities,
but she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new
of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities
were worn out like his information. It was a journey of only twenty-four
miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by
noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room
window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was
there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was
pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a
troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s
appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose
shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their
coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly
away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the
theatres. Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first
subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to
hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always
struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It
was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.
Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in
Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different
times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from
her heart, given up the acquaintance. Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her
niece on Wickham’s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so
well. “But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss
King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.” “Pray, my dear
aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the
mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice
begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it
would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with
only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.”
“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.” “She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no
harm of her.” “But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her
grandfather’s death made her mistress of this fortune.” “No—why should
he? If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections, because I had
no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he
did not care about, and who was equally poor?” “But there seems
indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this
event.” “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those
elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object
to it, why should we?” “Her not objecting, does not justify him. It only
shews her being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.”
“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary,
and she shall be foolish.” “No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I
should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so
long in Derbyshire.” “Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of
young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in
Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven!
I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable
quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men
are the only ones worth knowing, after all.” “Take care, Lizzy; that
speech savours strongly of disappointment.” Before they were separated
by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an
invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which
they proposed taking in the summer. “We have not quite determined how
far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “but perhaps to the Lakes.”
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear
aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me
fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men
to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And
when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being
able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We will know where we have
gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers,
shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt
to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its
relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than
those of the generality of travellers.” EVERY OBJECT IN the next day’s
journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a
state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to
banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour
was a constant source of delight. When they left the high road for the
lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every
turning expected to bring it in view. The paling of Rosings park was
their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all
that she had heard of its inhabitants. At length the Parsonage was
discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it,
the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were
arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the
carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to
the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment
they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.
Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and
Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found
herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin’s
manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just
what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear
and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with no
other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken
into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed
them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and
punctually repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment. Elizabeth was
prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that
in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its
furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to
make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though every thing
seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh
of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she
could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr. Collins
said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which
certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,
Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But
of all the views which his garden, or which the county, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground. From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led
them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter
the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William
accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house,
extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it
without her husband’s help. It was rather small, but well built and
convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness
and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When
Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort
throughout, and by Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth
supposed he must be often forgotten. She had already learnt that Lady
Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they
were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed, “Yes, Miss
Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh
on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be
delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt
not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home. Her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should
say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.” “Lady
Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added
Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.” “Very true, my dear, that
is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard
with too much deference.” The evening was spent chiefly in talking over
Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and
when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate
upon Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in
guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge
that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all. About the middle of
the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden
noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after
listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent
hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door, and met Maria
in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, “Oh, my
dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is
such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and
come down this moment.” Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would
tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which
fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in
a low phaeton at the garden gate. “And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I
expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is
nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!” “La! my dear,” said Maria
quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is
Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The other is Miss de Bourgh. Only
look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought she
could be so thin and small!” “She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte
out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?” “Oh! Charlotte
says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de
Bourgh comes in.” “I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with
other ideas. “She looks sickly and cross.—Yes, she will do for him very
well. She will make him a very proper wife.” Mr. Collins and Charlotte
were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir
William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in
earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing
whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way. At length there was nothing
more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the
house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to
congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by
letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the
next day. MR. COLLINS’S TRIUMPH in consequence of this invitation was
complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his
wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself
and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for, and that an
opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of
Lady Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough. “I
confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by her
Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival!” “I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied
Sir William, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great
really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About
the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them. When
the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth, “Do
not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.” While they were dressing, he came two or three times to
their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine
very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.—Such formidable
accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened
Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward
to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father
had done to his presentation at St. James’s. As the weather was fine,
they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.—Every
park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be
pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins
expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his
enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of
what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment
increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm.—Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation. From the entrance hall,
of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine
proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an
antichamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and
Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.—Her Ladyship, with great condescension,
arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her
husband that the office of introduction should be her’s, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary. In spite of having been at
St. James’s, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur
surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low
bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter,
frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not
knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the
scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.—Lady
Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which
might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her
manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their
inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever
she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her
self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s
mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady
Catherine to be exactly what he had represented. When, after examining
the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some
resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could
almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment, at her being so thin, and so
small. There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the
ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not
plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low
voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing
remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said,
and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. After
sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer. The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there
were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins
had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the
bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt
that life could furnish nothing greater.—He carved, and ate, and praised
with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and
then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his
son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine
could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive
admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on
the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much
conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an
opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the
former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the
latter said not a word to her all dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was
chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her
to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed. Maria thought
speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and
admire. When the ladies returned to the drawing room, there was little
to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte’s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her’s, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great Lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother’s maiden name?—Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.—Lady Catherine then
observed, “Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For
your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see
no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.—It was not
thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.—Do you play and sing,
Miss Bennet?” “A little.” “Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy
to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to—You
shall try it some day.—Do your sisters play and sing?” “One of them
does.” “Why did not you all learn?—You ought all to have learned. The
Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your’s.—Do you draw?” “No, not at all.” “What, none of you?” “Not one.”
“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”
“Has your governess left you?” “We never had any governess.” “No
governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!—I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.” Elizabeth could hardly help
smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case. “Then, who
taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been
neglected.” “Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of
us as wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged
to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to
be idle, certainly might.” “Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess
will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her
most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done
in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a
governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the
means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person
well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully
situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I
recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned
to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I
tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds
Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a
treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?” “Yes,
Ma’am, all.” “All!—What, all five out at once? Very odd!—And you only
the second.—The younger ones out before the elder are married!—Your
younger sisters must be very young?” “Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, Ma’am, I
think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not
have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have
the means or inclination to marry early.—The last born has as good a
right to the pleasures of youth, as the first. And to be kept back on
such a motive!—I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly
affection or delicacy of mind.” “Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you
give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.—Pray, what is
your age?” “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth
smiling, “your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.” Lady Catherine
seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth
suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle
with so much dignified impertinence. “You cannot be more than twenty, I
am sure,—therefore you need not conceal your age.” “I am not one and
twenty.” When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card
tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and
Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play
at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to
make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a
syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when
Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or
too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more
passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating
the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said,
thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won
too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with
anecdotes and noble names. When Lady Catherine and her daughter had
played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was
offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine
what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions
they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches
of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir
William’s, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door,
Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that
she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more
favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her
some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very
soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s praise into his own hands. SIR
WILLIAM STAID only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to
convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement. From the drawing room
they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to
Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how
often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never
failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’
conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get
out. Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings,
and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go
likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other
family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice
of so many hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her
Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the
room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at
their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the
arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence;
and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake
of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her
family. Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in
the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active
magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were
carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were
disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth
into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints,
and scold them into harmony and plenty. The entertainment of dining at
Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of
Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every
such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other
engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in
general, was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This however was no evil to
Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough;
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the
weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great
enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently
went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open
grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice
sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she
felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity. In this quiet way,
the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was
approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the
family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected
there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of
her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one
comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be
amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his
behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady
Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction,
spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry
to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and
herself. His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins
was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into
Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after
making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with
the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings
to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require
them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the
younger son of his uncle, Lord——, and to the great surprise of all the
party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.
Charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and
immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they
might expect, adding, “I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of
civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.”
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word. Colonel Fitzwilliam entered
into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred
man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed
a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for
some time without speaking to any body. At length, however, his civility
was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her
family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment’s pause,
added, “My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you
never happened to see her there?” She was perfectly sensible that he
never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any
consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she
thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never
been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no
farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. COLONEL
FITZWILLIAM’S MANNERS were very much admired at the parsonage, and the
ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their
engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received
any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they
could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week
after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by such an
attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come
there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of
either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at
the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had
only seen at church. The invitation was accepted of course, and at a
proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing room. Her
ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was
by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she
was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,
especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out, “What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is
it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear
what it is.” “We are speaking of music, Madam,” said he, when no longer
able to avoid a reply. “Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all
subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation, if you
are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who
have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural
taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And
so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident
that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on,
Darcy?” Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise to his sister’s
proficiency. “I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said
Lady Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to
excel, if she does not practise a great deal.” “I assure you, Madam,” he
replied, “that she does not need such advice. She practises very
constantly.” “So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I
next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be
acquired, without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several
times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more;
and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I
have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the
pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you
know, in that part of the house.” Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of
his aunt’s ill breeding, and made no answer. When coffee was over,
Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to
him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near
her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before,
to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving
with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte, stationed himself so
as to command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance. Elizabeth
saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him
with an arch smile, and said, “You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by
coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though
your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that
never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always
rises with every attempt to intimidate me.” “I shall not say that you
are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not really believe me to
entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of
your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in
occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.”
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave
to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.” “I am not
afraid of you,” said he, smilingly. “Pray let me hear what you have to
accuse him of,” cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he
behaves among strangers.” “You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for
something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in
Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do
you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you—but
so it was. He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;
and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down
in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.” “I had not
at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my
own party.” “True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your
orders.” “Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I
sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to
strangers.” “Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said
Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a
man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is
ill-qualified to recommend himself to strangers?” “I can answer your
question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to him. It is because he
will not give himself the trouble.” “I certainly have not the talent
which some people possess,” said Darcy, “of conversing easily with those
I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or
appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.” “My fingers,”
said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner
which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same force or
rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always
supposed it to be my own fault—because I would not take the trouble of
practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any
other woman’s of superior execution.” Darcy smiled and said, “You are
perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one
admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.
We neither of us perform to strangers.” Here they were interrupted by
Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.
Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached,
and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy, “Miss Bennet
would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the
advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering,
though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have been a
delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.” Elizabeth
looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin’s praise;
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any
symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh
she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just
as likely to marry her, had she been his relation. Lady Catherine
continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing with them many
instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all
the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen
remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was ready to
take them all home. ELIZABETH WAS SITTING by herself the next morning,
and writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business
into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the
certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought
it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was
putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all
impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great
surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room. He seemed
astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion,
by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed, “How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield
last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to
Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right,
he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when
you left London.” “Perfectly so—I thank you.” She found that she was to
receive no other answer—and, after a short pause, added, “I think I have
understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to
Netherfield again?” “I have never heard him say so; but it is probable
that he may spend very little of his time there in future. He has many
friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are
continually increasing.” “If he means to be but little at Netherfield,
it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the
place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.
But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the
convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him
to keep or quit it on the same principle.” “I should not be surprised,”
said Darcy, “if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase
offers.” Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of
his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave
the trouble of finding a subject to him. He took the hint, and soon
began with, “This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I
believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to
Hunsford.” “I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful object.” “Mr. Collins appears very
fortunate in his choice of a wife.” “Yes, indeed; his friends may well
rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who
would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend
has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider
her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems
perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a
very good match for her.” “It must be very agreeable to her to be
settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.” “An
easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.” “And what is
fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s journey. Yes, I
call it a very easy distance.” “I should never have considered the
distance as one of the advantages of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I
should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.” “It is
a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Any thing beyond the
very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.” As he
spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood;
he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she
blushed as she answered, “I do not mean to say that a woman may not be
settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and
depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the
expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is
not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but
not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the
present distance.” Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and
said “You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You
cannot have been always at Longbourn.” Elizabeth looked surprised. The
gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair,
took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a
colder voice, “Are you pleased with Kent?” A short dialogue on the
subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—and soon
put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned
from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the
mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after
sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.
“What can be the meaning of this!” said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. “My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way.” But when Elizabeth told of his
silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be
the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose
his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do,
which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were
over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard
table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness
of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the
people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this
period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times
of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and
then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel
Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion
which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded
by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident
admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though,
in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best
informed mind. But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was
more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he
frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and
when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of
choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom
appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved
that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could
not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change
the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she
sat herself seriously to work to find it out.—She watched him whenever
they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much
success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the
expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, stedfast
gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it,
and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. She had once or
twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to
her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not
think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising
expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion
it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish,
if she could suppose him to be in her power. In her kind schemes for
Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He
was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and
his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counter balance these
advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his
cousin could have none at all. MORE THAN ONCE did Elizabeth in her
ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.—She felt all the
perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else
was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to
inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.—How it could
occur a second time therefore was very odd!—Yet it did, and even a
third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on
these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward
pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back
and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself
the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the
course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected
questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary
walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in
speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he
seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be
staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he
must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage. She was engaged one day as she walked, in
re-perusing Jane’s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which
proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being
again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel
Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and
forcing a smile, she said, “I did not know before that you ever walked
this way.” “I have been making the tour of the Park,” he replied, “as I
generally do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the
Parsonage. Are you going much farther?” “No, I should have turned in a
moment.” And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the
Parsonage together. “Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
“Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.” “And if not able to please
himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power
of choice. I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of
doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.” “He likes to have his own way very
well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. “But so we all do. It is only that
he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich,
and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know,
must be inured to self-denial and dependence.” “In my opinion, the
younger son of an Earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously,
what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you
been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or
procuring any thing you had a fancy for?” “These are home questions—and
perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that
nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of
money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.” “Unless where they
like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.” “Our habits of
expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life
who can afford to marry without some attention to money.” “Is this,”
thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the idea; but,
recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “and pray, what is the usual
price of an Earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly,
I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.” He answered
her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence
which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon
afterwards said, “I imagine your cousin brought you down with him
chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he
does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,
perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under
his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.” “No,” said Colonel
Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am
joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.” “Are you, indeed?
And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you
much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult
to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have
her own way.” As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly,
and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss
Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had
somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied, “You
need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say
she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very
great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.” “I know them
a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man—he is a great
friend of Darcy’s.” “Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily—“Mr. Darcy is
uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of
him.” “Care of him!—Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.” “What is it you
mean?” “It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family,
it would be an unpleasant thing.” “You may depend upon my not mentioning
it.” “And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.” “Did
Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?” “I understood
that there were some very strong objections against the lady.” “And what
arts did he use to separate them?” “He did not talk to me of his own
arts,” said Fitzwilliam smiling. “He only told me, what I have now told
you.” Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful. “I am thinking of what you have been telling me,”
said she. “Your cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he
to be the judge?” “You are rather disposed to call his interference
officious?” “I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the
propriety of his friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgment
alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to
be happy. But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of
the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.” “That is not an unnatural
surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is lessening the honour of my
cousin’s triumph very sadly.” This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared
to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself
with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation,
talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage. There,
shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could
think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be
supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she
was connected. There could not exist in the world two men, over whom
Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been
concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she
had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the
principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however,
did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the
cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He
had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most
affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how
lasting an evil he might have inflicted. “There were some very strong
objections against the lady,” were Colonel Fitzwilliam’s words, and
these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a
country attorney, and another who was in business in London. “To Jane
herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of objection.
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her
mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could any thing be
urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, his
abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability
which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of her mother
indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that
any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride,
she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friend’s connections, than from their want of sense;
and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by
this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining
Mr. Bingley for his sister. The agitation and tears which the subject
occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the
evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined
her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to
drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not
press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from
pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady
Catherine’s being rather displeased by her staying at home. WHEN THEY
WERE gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as
possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of
all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past
occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and
in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness
which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding
from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed
towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed
every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which
it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast
of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of
her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit
to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater,
that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and
enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that
affection could do. She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent, without
remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam
had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he
was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him. While settling this
point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her
spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel
Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and
might now come to enquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon
banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her
utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried
manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his
visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with
cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked
about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a
silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner,
and thus began, “In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings
will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I
admire and love you.” Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression.
She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered
sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had
long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were
feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more
eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her
inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which
judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth
which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very
unlikely to recommend his suit. In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike,
she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection,
and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first
sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his
subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried,
however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should
have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that
attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found
impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be
rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could
easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of
apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased,
the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said, “In such cases as this,
it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation
for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is
natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I
would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good
opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry
to have occasioned pain to any one. It has been most unconsciously done,
however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you
tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have
little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.” Mr. Darcy,
who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her
face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind
was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of
composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have
attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length,
in a voice of forced calmness, he said, “And this is all the reply which
I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be
informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected.
But it is of small importance.” “I might as well enquire,” replied she,
“why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose
to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and
even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if
I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not
my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had
they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would
tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps
for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?” As she pronounced
these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he
listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued. “I
have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse
the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot
deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing
them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for
caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed
hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.” She
paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an
air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even
looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity. “Can you deny that
you have done it?” she repeated. With assumed tranquillity he then
replied, “I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power
to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.
Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.” Elizabeth disdained
the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did
not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her. “But it is not merely
this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike is founded. Long
before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your character
was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from
Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what
imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what
misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?” “You take an eager
interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy in a less tranquil
tone, and with a heightened colour. “Who that knows what his misfortunes
have been, can help feeling an interest in him?” “His misfortunes!”
repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes have been great
indeed.” “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You
have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been
designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that
independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done
all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with
contempt and ridicule.” “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick
steps across the room, “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in
which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,
according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he,
stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might
have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest
confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any
serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had
I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the
belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by
reason, by reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my
abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were
natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of
your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?” Elizabeth felt
herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to
speak with composure when she said, “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you
suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way,
than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing
you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.” She saw him start
at this, but he said nothing, and she continued, “You could not have
made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have
tempted me to accept it.” Again his astonishment was obvious; and he
looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and
mortification. She went on. “From the very beginning, from the first
moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners
impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit,
and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form
that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have
built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I
felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be
prevailed on to marry.” “You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly
comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own
have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and
accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.” And with these
words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment
open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of her mind was now
painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual
weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. Her astonishment, as she
reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That
she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should
have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to
wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him
prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least
with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was
gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But
his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had
done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging,
though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had
mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to
deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment
had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitating reflections
till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal
she was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to
her room. ELIZABETH AWOKE THE next morning to the same thoughts and
meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet
recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to
think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she
resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection
of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of
entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from
the turnpike road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side,
and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground. After walking two
or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the
pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the
park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great
difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of
the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she
caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the
park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she
was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now near
enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her
name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a
voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she
instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, “I have been
walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do
me the honour of reading that letter?”—And then, with a slight bow,
turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight. With no
expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth
opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an
envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through,
in a very close hand.—The envelope itself was likewise full.—Pursuing
her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at
eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:— Be not alarmed,
Madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing
any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which
were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of
paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the
happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which
the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have
been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly but I
demand it of your justice. Two offences of a very different nature, and
by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The
first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had
detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,—and the other, that I had, in
defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined
the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of
Mr. Wickham.—Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had
scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been
brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the
separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of
only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.—But from the severity of
that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each
circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following
account of my actions and their motives has been read.—If, in the
explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of
relating feelings which may be offensive to your’s, I can only say that
I am sorry.—The necessity must be obeyed—and farther apology would be
absurd.—I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common
with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
young woman in the country.—But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment.—I had often seen him in love before.—At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be
undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour
attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched.—Her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment.—If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in an
error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable.—If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict
pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and
air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction
that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily
touched.—That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain,—but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.—I did not believe her
to be indifferent because I wished it;—I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.—My objections to the
marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have
required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the
want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to
me.—But there were other causes of repugnance;—causes which, though
still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me.—These causes must be stated, though briefly.—The situation of your
mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father.—Pardon me.—It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.—I will only say
farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection.—He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.—The part
which I acted, is now to be explained.—His sisters’ uneasiness had been
equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon
discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching
their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.—We
accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing
out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.—I described, and
enforced them earnestly.—But, however this remonstrance might have
staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would
ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the
assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s
indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with
sincere, if not with equal regard.—But Bingley has great natural
modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.—To
convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very
difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire,
when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a
moment.—I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but
one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect
with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of
art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in town. I knew it
myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet
ignorant of it.—That they might have met without ill consequence, is
perhaps probable;—but his regard did not appear to me enough
extinguished for him to see her without some danger.—Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.—It is done, however, and it
was done for the best.—On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was
unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you
very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.—With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having
injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole
of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me
I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon
more than one witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a
very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust,
naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on George
Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally
bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at
Cambridge;—most important assistance, as his own father, always poor
from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a
gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young man’s
society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest
opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended
to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I
first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious
propensities—the want of principle which he was careful to guard from
the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a
young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities
of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here
again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But
whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real
character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father died about
five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so
steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to
promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living
might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one
thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within
half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that,
having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not
think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I
must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be
sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.
I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The business was
therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance in the
church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive
it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between
us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him, to invite him to
Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well
assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have
forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame me for
refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition
of it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to
others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every
appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But last
summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I must now
mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no
obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human
being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My
sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the
guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any
public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge.
Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
been complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every
event in which we have been concerned together, and if you do not
absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of
cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form
of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning
either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not
told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know
what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of every thing here
related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel
Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been
unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If
your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be
prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there
may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you. Fitzwilliam Darcy. IF
ELIZABETH, WHEN Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and stedfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It
was all pride and insolence. But when this subject was succeeded by his
account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a
relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished
opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own
history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more
difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror,
oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly
exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the
grossest falsehood!”—and when she had gone through the whole letter,
though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it
hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would
never look in it again. In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts
that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half
a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well
as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related
to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of
every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family,
was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late
Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally
well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but
when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had
said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very
words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on
one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself
that her wishes did not err. But when she read, and re-read with the
closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham’s
resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so
considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to
hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what
she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each
statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion.
Again she read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair,
which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so
represent, as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous,
was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout
the whole. The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not
to lay to Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as
she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him
before his entrance into the——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at
the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in
town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of
life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
never felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no
such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morn ing before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin’s corroboration. She perfectly remembered every thing that had
passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first
evening at Mr. Philips’s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in
her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such
communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and
the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered
that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy
might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had
avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also,
that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told
his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had
been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in
sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that respect
for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son. How
differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His
attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling. That had his
actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible. She grew absolutely ashamed of
herself.—Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling
that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd. “How despicably
have I acted!” she cried.—“I, who have prided myself on my
discernment!—I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often
disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in
useless or blameable distrust.—How humiliating is this discovery!—Yet,
how just a humiliation!—Had I been in love, I could not have been more
wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly.—Pleased with
the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the
very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and
ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till
this moment, I never knew myself.” From herself to Jane—from Jane to
Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her
recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation there, had appeared very
insufficient; and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of
a second perusal.—How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in
one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?—He
declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister’s
attachment;—and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion
had always been.—Neither could she deny the justice of his description
of Jane.—She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent, were little
displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and
manner, not often united with great sensibility. When she came to that
part of the letter, in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such
mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The
justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the
circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the
Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could
not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. The
compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed, but it
could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;—and as she considered that
Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before. After wandering along the lane for two hours,
giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events,
determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could,
to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of
her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the
house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution
of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.—Elizabeth could but just affect concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object. She could think only of her letter. THE TWO GENTLEMEN
left rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting
near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring
home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health,
and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy
scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened to
console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought
back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing
that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having
them all to dine with her. Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine
without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time
have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think,
without a smile, of what her ladyship’s indignation would have been.
“What would she have said?—how would she have behaved?” were questions
with which she amused herself. Their first subject was the diminution of
the Rosings party.—“I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady
Catherine; “I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be
so much attached to me!—They were excessively sorry to go! But so they
always are. The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at
last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last
year. His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases.” Mr. Collins had a
compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled
on by the mother and daughter. Lady Catherine observed, after dinner,
that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for
it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon,
she added, “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to
beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of
your company, I am sure.” “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your
kind invitation,” replied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to
accept it.—I must be in town next Saturday.” “Why, at that rate, you
will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I
told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your
going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another
fortnight.” “But my father cannot.—He wrote last week to hurry my
return.” “Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother
can.—Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you
will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of
you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week;
and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very
good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be
cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
large.” “You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.” Lady Catherine seemed resigned.— “Mrs. Collins, you must
send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot
bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is
highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest
dislike in the world to that sort of thing.—Young women should always be
properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of
her having two men servants go with her.—Miss Darcy, the daughter of
Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner.—I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am
glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to you to let them go alone.” “My uncle is to send a
servant for us.” “Oh!—Your uncle!—He keeps a man-servant, does he?—I am
very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you
change horses?—Oh! Bromley, of course.—If you mention my name at the
Bell, you will be attended to.” Lady Catherine had many other questions
to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all
herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky
for her, or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she
was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was
alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by
without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight
of unpleasant recollections. Mr. Darcy’s letter, she was in a fair way
of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence: and her feelings
towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered
the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when
she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her
anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became
the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general
character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a
moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see
him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of
vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject
of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,
contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain
the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with
manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the
imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by
their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?
Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia’s
guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia,
self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were
ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they
would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn,
they would be going there for ever. Anxiety on Jane’s behalf, was
another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy’s explanation, by restoring
Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what
Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his
conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the
implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the
thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete
with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by
the folly and indecorum of her own family! When to these recollections
was added the developement of Wickham’s character, it may be easily
believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before,
were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to
appear tolerably cheerful. Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent
during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first. The very
last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely
into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the
best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing
gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her
return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both. ON SATURDAY MORNING Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for
breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the
opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed
indispensably necessary. “I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether
Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to
us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving
her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I
assure you. We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble
abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics,
and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to
a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for
the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to
prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.” Elizabeth was eager with
her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with
great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind
attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins
was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied, “It gives me
the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
Lady Catherine’s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not
think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.” Words were insufficient for the
elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room,
while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short
sentences. “You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.” Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where
that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly
believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry,
however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the
lady from whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!—it was melancholy to leave
her to such society!—But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and
though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not
seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish
and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost
their charms. At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on,
the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an
affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the
carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was
commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not
forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in
the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though
unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the
point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some
consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for
the ladies of Rosings. “But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have
your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for
their kindness to you while you have been here.” Elizabeth made no
objection;—the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove
off. “Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, “it
seems but a day or two since we first came!—and yet how many things have
happened!” “A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh. “We
have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!—How
much I shall have to tell!” Elizabeth privately added, “and how much I
shall have to conceal.” Their journey was performed without much
conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving
Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner’s house, where they were to remain a
few days. Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of
studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness
of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and
at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation. It was not
without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn,
before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know that she
had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and
must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she
had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness
as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which
she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her
fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther. IT WAS THE second week in May, in which the three young ladies
set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of——in
Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where
Mr. Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token
of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a
dining room up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the
place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the
sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber. After welcoming
their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such
cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, “Is not this
nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?” “And we mean to treat you
all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the money, for we have just
spent ours at the shop out there.” Then shewing her purchases: “Look
here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I
thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon
as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.” And when her
sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, “Oh! but
there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought
some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be
very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this
summer, after the——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a
fortnight.” “Are they indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest
satisfaction. “They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so
want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a
delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.
Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable
summer else we shall have!” “Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “that would be a
delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good
Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been
overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls
of Meryton.” “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat
down to table. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news,
and about a certain person that we all like.” Jane and Elizabeth looked
at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay. Lydia
laughed, and said, “Aye, that is just like your formality and
discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare
say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is
an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my
life. Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for
the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary
King. There’s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone
to stay. Wickham is safe.” “And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth;
“safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.” “She is a great fool
for going away, if she liked him.” “But I hope there is no strong
attachment on either side,” said Jane. “I am sure there is not on his. I
will answer for it he never cared three straws about her. Who could
about such a nasty little freckled thing?” Elizabeth was shocked to
think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself,
the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had
formerly harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the
elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance,
the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the
unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.
“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken
Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it.
Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I
would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good
piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to
spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in
the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,—only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col. and
Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to
borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When
Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in,
they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did
Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men
suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth, “I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; Lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her. “Oh! Mary,”
said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went
along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was
nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had
not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very
handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon
in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should
have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we
were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any
body might have heard us ten miles off!” To this, Mary very gravely
replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such
pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of
female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me. I should
infinitely prefer a book.” But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never
attended to Mary at all. In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest
of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but
Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said, that the
Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit
of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She
dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as
possible. The comfort to her, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was
indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone,
she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account. She
had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last. ELIZABETH’S
IMPATIENCE TO acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be
overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which
her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related
to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and
herself. Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong
sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear
perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.
She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a
manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she
grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given
him. “His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,” said she; “and
certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must
increase his disappointment.” “Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am
heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably
soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for
refusing him?” “Blame you! Oh, no.” “But you blame me for having spoken
so warmly of Wickham.” “No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying
what you did.” “But you will know it, when I have told you what happened
the very next day.” She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of
its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was
this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world
without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of
mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy’s
vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her
for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the
probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the
other. “This will not do,” said Elizabeth. “You never will be able to
make both of them good for any thing. Take your choice, but you must be
satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between
them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been
shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all
Mr. Darcy’s, but you shall do as you chuse.” It was some time, however,
before a smile could be extorted from Jane. “I do not know when I have
been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past
belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have
suffered. Such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill
opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is
really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.” “Oh! no, my
regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I
know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment
more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if
you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a
feather.” “Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.” “There
certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two
young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.” “I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the
appearance of it as you used to do.” “And yet I meant to be uncommonly
clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is
such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike
of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying any thing
just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then
stumbling on something witty.” “Lizzy, when you first read that letter,
I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.” “Indeed I could
not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very uncomfortable, I may say
unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort
me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as
I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!” “How unfortunate that you should
have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to
Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.” “Certainly. But
the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural
consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one
point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought,
or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham’s
character.” Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, “Surely there
can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own
opinion?” “That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not
authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary every
particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as
possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the
rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against
Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good
people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not
equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not
signify to anybody here, what he really is. Sometime hence it will be
all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing
it before. At present I will say nothing about it.” “You are quite
right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now
perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a
character. We must not make him desperate.” The tumult of Elizabeth’s
mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the
secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a
willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of
either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence
forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of
Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been
valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake;
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding
between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last
incumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very improbable
event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what
Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of
communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!” She was
now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of
her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very
tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love
before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her
age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity. “Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your
opinion now of this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined
never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the
other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in
London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose
there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I
have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know.” “I do not
believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.” “Oh, well it is
just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say
that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not
have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a
broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done.” But as
Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made
no answer. “Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother soon afterwards, “and so
the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their
housekeeping, I dare say.” “No, nothing at all.” “A great deal of good
management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. They will take care not to outrun
their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good
may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn
when your father is dead. They look upon it quite as their own, I dare
say, whenever that happens.” “It was a subject which they could not
mention before me.” “No. It would have been strange if they had. But I
make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they
can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the
better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”
THE FIRST WEEK of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family. “Good Heaven! What is to become
of us! What are we to do!” would they often exclaim in the bitterness of
woe. “How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?” Their affectionate mother
shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a
similar occasion, five and twenty years ago. “I am sure,” said she, “I
cried for two days together when Colonel Millar’s regiment went away. I
thought I should have broke my heart.” “I am sure I shall break mine,”
said Lydia. “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
“Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”
“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.” “And my aunt Philips is
sure it would do me a great deal of good,” added Kitty. Such were the
kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house.
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was
lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections; and
never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in
the views of his friend. But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly
cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife
of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This
invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A
resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and
Lydia to each other, and out of their three months’ acquaintance they
had been intimate two. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her
adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the
mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive
to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless
ecstacy, calling for every one’s congratulations, and laughing and
talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty
continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable
as her accent was peevish. “I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask
me as well as Lydia,” said she, “though I am not her particular friend.
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am
two years older.” In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable,
and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation
was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and
Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of
common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her
were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to
let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s
general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the
friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her
being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the
temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and
then said, “Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in
some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.” “If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great
disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of
Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen
from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.” “Already
arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away some of
your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish
youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not
worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.” “Indeed you are mistaken. I have
no such injuries to resent. It is not of peculiar, but of general evils,
which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the
world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and
disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse me—for I
must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of
checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present
pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond
the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at
sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her
family ridiculous. A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of
flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person;
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward
off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration
will excite. In this danger Kitty is also comprehended. She will follow
wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!
Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be
censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters
will not be often involved in the disgrace?” Mr. Bennet saw that her
whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said
in reply, “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Whenever you and Jane
are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to
less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but
her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and
sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by
dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to
fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of
her disposition. Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her
conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found
expression in their united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit
to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw
with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place
covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens
and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the
camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines,
crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to
complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly
flirting with at least six officers at once. Had she known that her
sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as
these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been
understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy
conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there himself. But
they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia’s leaving
home. Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having
been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was
pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She
had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first
delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In
his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of
displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those
attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could
only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all
concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such
idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could
not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long,
and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity
would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their
renewal. On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he
dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was
Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making
some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford,
she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent
three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the
former. He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, “How long did you
say that he was at Rosings?” “Nearly three weeks.” “And you saw him
frequently?” “Yes, almost every day.” “His manners are very different
from his cousin’s.” “Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves
on acquaintance.” “Indeed!” cried Wickham with a look which did not
escape her. “And pray may I ask?” but checking himself, he added in a
gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add
ought of civility to his ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he
continued in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is improved in
essentials.” “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is
very much what he ever was.” While she spoke, Wickham looked as if
scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their
meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen
with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, “When I
said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his
mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing
him better, his disposition was better understood.” Wickham’s alarm now
appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes
he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her
again, and said in the gentlest of accents, “You, who so well know my
feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must
rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is
right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to
himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct
as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to
which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his
visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in
awe. His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were
together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the
match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at
heart.” Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered
only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to
engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no
humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the
appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther
attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual
civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. When the
party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence
they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her
and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one
who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was
diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and
impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of
enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every
reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness
of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her
sisters were uttered without being heard. HAD ELIZABETH’S OPINION been
all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing
picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father captivated
by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and
beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and
illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real
affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for
ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But
Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the
disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those
pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or
their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these
tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very
little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had
contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a
man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of
entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from
such as are given. Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the
impropriety of her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen
it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his
affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she
could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual
breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to
the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she
had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend
the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware
of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents
which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of
his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. When
Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little other
cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad
were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister
whose constant repinings at the dullness of every thing around them,
threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might
in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her
brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater
evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly
and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place
and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect. “But it is
fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for. Were the
whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But
here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister’s
absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure
realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be
successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence
of some little peculiar vexation.” When Lydia went away, she promised to
write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her
letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her
mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from
the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where
she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she
had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more
fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster
called her, and they were going to the camp;—and from her correspondence
with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to
Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words
to be made public. After the first fortnight or three weeks of her
absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at
Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been
in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer
engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous
serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be
able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as
to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so
tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day,
unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office,
another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the
beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a
fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from
Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its
extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out
till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a
month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and
see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure
and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes,
and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present
plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that county,
there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks;
and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town
where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they
were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her
curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak. Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had
set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have
been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly
her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again. With the mention
of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for
her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. “But
surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of
a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.” The period of
expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her
uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them. The Gardiners
staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with
Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was
certain—that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which
comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to
enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might
supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad. It is
not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of
any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay;
Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &amp;c. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation. “My love,
should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?”
said her aunt. “A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are
connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.” Elizabeth was
distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was
obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she
was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no
pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains. Mrs. Gardiner abused her
stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,” said she,
“I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They
have some of the finest woods in the country.” Elizabeth said no
more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting
Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be
dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better
to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk. But against this,
there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the
last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family,
were unfavourably answered. Accordingly, when she retired at night, she
asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what
was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the
family were down for the summer. A most welcome negative followed the
last question—and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to
feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the
subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to,
could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she
had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they
were to go. ELIZABETH, AS THEY drove along, watched for the first
appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length
they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter. The
park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered
it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a
beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent. Elizabeth’s mind was too
full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and
point of view. They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found
themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,
and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the
opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness
wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising
ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;—and in front, a
stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without
any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely
adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which
nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little
counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their
admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of
Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the
bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of
the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned. She
dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the
place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited
for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings. “And of
this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With these rooms
I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as
a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to
them as visitors my uncle and aunt.—But no,”—recollecting herself,—“that
could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should
not have been allowed to invite them.” This was a lucky recollection—it
saved her from something like regret. She longed to enquire of the
housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage
for it. At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she
turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied, that he was,
adding, “but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.”
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any
circumstance been delayed a day! Her aunt now called her to look at a
picture. She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended,
amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece. Her aunt asked
her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told
them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late
master’s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.—“He
is now gone into the army,” she added, “but I am afraid he has turned
out very wild.” Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but
Elizabeth could not return it. “And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing
to another of the miniatures, “is my master—and very like him. It was
drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago.” “I have
heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at
the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether
it is like or not.” Mrs. Reynolds’s respect for Elizabeth seemed to
increase on this intimation of her knowing her master. “Does that young
lady know Mr. Darcy?” Elizabeth coloured, and said—“A little.” “And do
not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma’am?” “Yes, very
handsome.” “I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up
stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room
was my late master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as
they used to be then. He was very fond of them.” This accounted to
Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them. Mrs. Reynolds then
directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only
eight years old. “And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said
Mr. Gardiner. “Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and
so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him.” Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy
and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and
remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment; had evidently
great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. “Is your master
much at Pemberley in the course of the year?” “Not so much as I could
wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss
Darcy is always down for the summer months.” “Except,” thought
Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.” “If your master would marry, you
might see more of him.” “Yes, Sir; but I do not know when that will be.
I do not know who is good enough for him.” Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.
Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is very much to his credit, I am
sure, that you should think so.” “I say no more than the truth, and what
every body will say that knows him,” replied the other. Elizabeth
thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing
astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have never had a cross word
from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years
old.” This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite
to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying, “There are very few people of
whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.” “Yes,
Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not meet
with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world.” Elizabeth almost stared at her.—“Can this be Mr. Darcy!” thought
she. “His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner. “Yes, Ma’am,
that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to
the poor.” Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for
more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related
the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price
of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of
family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of
her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on
his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase. “He
is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever lived.
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never
saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men.” “In what an amiable light does this place
him!” thought Elizabeth. “This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt,
as they walked, “is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor
friend.” “Perhaps we might be deceived.” “That is not very likely; our
authority was too good.” On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were
shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater
elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that
it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a
liking to the room, when last at Pemberley. “He is certainly a good
brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter
the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added.—“Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her.” The picture-gallery, and two or
three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn. In
the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the
art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly
turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose
subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible. In
the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little
to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest of the
only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
her—and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he
looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father’s life
time. There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more
gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the
height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by
Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable
than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a
master, she considered how many people’s happiness were in his
guardianship!—How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to
bestow!—How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that
had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his
character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was
represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard
with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she
remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression. When
all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they
returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door. As they
walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look
again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility. She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on
his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible
to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the
picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the
other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of
surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They
stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who,
astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and
knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her
family. Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted,
every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and
every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her
mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the
most uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when
he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated
his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her
stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke
the distraction of his thoughts. At length, every idea seemed to fail
him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he
suddenly recollected himself, and took leave. The others then joined
her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard
not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in
silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was
the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How
strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not
strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown
herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come
a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner,
they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was
plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his
horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness
of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,—what could it
mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with
such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she
seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such
gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer
to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her
hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it. They had
now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step
was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the
woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before
Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure. At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her
absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more
like herself. They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for
a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the
opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming
views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour
changed, and she said no more. Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little
behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour
of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for
which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile,
at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people,
against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will
be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they are! He takes
them now for people of fashion.” The introduction, however, was
immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she
stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the
expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful
companions. That he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he
sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned
back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was
consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was
no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed
between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her
uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From
what can it proceed? It cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that
his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work
such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in
Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that you
would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left
Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the
country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business
with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before
the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They will join
me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some who will
claim an acquaintance with you,—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.” Elizabeth
answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back
to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned between
them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very
differently engaged. “There is also one other person in the party,” he
continued after a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to
you,—Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to
your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?” The surprise of such an
application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what
manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss
Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her
brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was
gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill
of her. They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was
flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a
compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and
when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a
quarter of a mile behind. He then asked her to walk into the house—but
she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At
such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At
last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of
Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt
moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before
the tête-à-tête was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up, they
were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but
this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost
politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it
drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house. The
observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.
“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
“There is something a little stately in him to be sure,” replied her
aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it.” “I was never more surprised than by his
behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and
there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with
Elizabeth was very trifling.” “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is
not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance,
for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he
was so disagreeable?” Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could;
said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before,
and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. “But
perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied her
uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at
his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds.” Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken
his character, but said nothing. “From what we have seen of him,”
continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really should not have thought that he could
have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor
Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is
something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is
something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an
unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure, the good lady who shewed
us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help
laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and
that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.” Elizabeth here
felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour
to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a
manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in
Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and
that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable,
as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this,
she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which
they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but
stating it to be such as might be relied on. Mrs. Gardiner was surprised
and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former
pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was
too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting
spots in its environs, to think of any thing else. Fatigued as she had
been by the morning’s walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off
again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in
the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years
discontinuance. The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to
leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she
could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s
civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his
sister. ELIZABETH HAD SETTLED it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister
to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was
consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of
that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning
after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been
walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just
returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family,
when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a
gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth
immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted
no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with
the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement;
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the
circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day,
opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it
before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for
such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for
their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads,
the perturbation of Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing.
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes
of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have
said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please,
she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her. She
retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up
and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable. Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale
than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was
formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome
than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and
her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had
expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever
Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different
feelings. They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that
Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to
express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s
quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.
All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done. To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting
personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole
party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions
which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their
observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and
they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them
at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they
remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with
admiration was evident enough. Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted
to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the
latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of
success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were
prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and
Darcy determined, to be pleased. In seeing Bingley, her thoughts
naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know,
whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could
fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice
pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying
to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could
not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up
as a rival of Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke
particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the
hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or
three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her
anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured
by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention
of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others
were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret,
that it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing
her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight months.
We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing
together at Netherfield.” Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so
exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by
any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was
not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a
look and a manner which gave them meaning. It was not often that she
could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a
glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that
he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of
his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which
she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might
prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the
acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any
intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw
him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he
had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in
Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck
so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment
from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at
Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so
desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve
as now, when no importance could result from the success of his
endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his
attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of
the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings. Their visitors staid with
them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called
on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left
the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her
little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner
looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation
most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had
turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance
spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the
proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect
willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and
the day after the next was fixed on. Bingley expressed great pleasure in
the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to
say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire
friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak
of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others,
found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the
last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the
enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of
enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only
long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then
hurried away to dress. But she had no reason to fear Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her
communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with
Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was
very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to
justify enquiry. Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think
well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to
find. They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn
his character from their own feelings, and his servant’s report, without
any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which
he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now
an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became
sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was
four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not
to be hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the
intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its
weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably
had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a
small market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged. As for Elizabeth her
thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last, and the
evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to
determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake
two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not
hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long
been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so
called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities,
though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be
repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a
friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and
bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday
had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a
motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. It was
gratitude.—Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for
loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony
of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his
addresses. It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and
niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them
on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only
to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be
equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and,
consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at
Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go.—Elizabeth
was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very
little to say in reply. Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The
fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive
engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by
noon. CONVINCED AS ELIZABETH now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her
had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very
unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to
know with how much civility on that lady’s side, the acquaintance would
now be renewed. On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall
into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for
summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing
view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks
and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn. In
this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.
Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that
embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of
doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior,
the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her. By Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated,
a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few
moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel,
agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of
discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss
Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more. The next variation
which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with
cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but
this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile
from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her
post. There was now employment for the whole party; for though they
could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of
grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came. He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with
two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,
and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended
a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than
Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;—a
resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more
easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were
awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not
watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance
was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in
spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one
of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her
attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her
brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw
that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and
forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either
side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of
anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,
“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the——shire militia removed from Meryton? They
must be a great loss to your family.” In Darcy’s presence she dared not
mention Wickham’s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was
uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with
him gave her a moment’s distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to
repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a
tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed
her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and
his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had
Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she
undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely
intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man
to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which
might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of
all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were
connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss
Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where
secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s
connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from
that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their
becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and
without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from
Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively
concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth’s collected behaviour,
however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and
disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also
recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her
brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest
in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn
his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and
more cheerfully. Their visit did not continue long after the question
and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to
their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join
her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as
to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister. “How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,”
she cried; “I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is
since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were
agreeing that we should not have known her again.” However little
Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with
coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being
rather tanned,—no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.
“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see
any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.” Persuaded as Miss Bingley was
that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of
recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in
seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she
expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of
making him speak, she continued, “I remember, when we first knew her in
Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed
beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they
had been dining at Netherfield, ‘She a beauty!—I should as soon call her
mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I
believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.” “Yes,” replied
Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but that was only when I
first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one
of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.” He then went away, and Miss
Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say
what gave no one any pain but herself. Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth
talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned
except what had particularly interested them both. The looks and
behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the
person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his
sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself;
yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and
Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s beginning
the subject. ELIZABETH HAD BEEN a good deal disappointed in not finding
a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this
disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now
been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her
sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one
of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was
not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:
Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most
unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!—Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides!—But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and
let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written. Without allowing herself time for
consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on
finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with
the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later
than the conclusion of the first. By this time, my dearest sister, you
have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible,
but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot
answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent
as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are
now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much
reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came
yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the
express. Though Lydia’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand
that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny
expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry
Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the
alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them
easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they
removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to
continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every
possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into
Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the
inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had
been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to
Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable
to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F: but no one can
throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My
father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married
privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could
form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections, which
is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing?—Impossible. I
grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon
their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill and
keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is
not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so
affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment;
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder. I am truly glad,
dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing
scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for
your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if
inconvenient. Adieu. I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told
you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help
earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my
dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it,
though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is
going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.
What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress
will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and
Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In
such an exigence my uncle’s advice and assistance would be every thing
in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I
rely upon his goodness. “Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth,
darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow
him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached
the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale
face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover
himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by
Lydia’s situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must
leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot
be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.” “Good God! what is the
matter?” cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting
himself, “I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the
servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough;—you
cannot go yourself.” Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under
her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue
them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though
in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch
his master and mistress home, instantly. On his quitting the room, she
sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that
it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in
a tone of gentleness and commiseration, “Let me call your maid. Is there
nothing you could take, to give you present relief?—A glass of
wine;—shall I get you one?—You are very ill.” “No, I thank you;” she
replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There is nothing the matter
with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by some dreadful news
which I have just received from Longbourn.” She burst into tears as she
alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of
his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length, she
spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful
news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My youngest sister has left
all her friends—has eloped;—has thrown herself into the power of—of
Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too
well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that
can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.” Darcy was fixed in astonishment.
“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that I
might have prevented it!—I who knew what he was. Had I but explained
some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had
his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,
all too late now.” “I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy;
“grieved—shocked. But is it certain, absolutely certain?” “Oh yes!—They
left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to
London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.” “And
what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?” “My father
is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s immediate
assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But nothing
can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a
man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the
smallest hope. It is every way horrible!” Darcy shook his head in silent
acquiescence. “When my eyes were opened to his real character.—Oh! had I
known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of
doing too much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!” Darcy made no answer. He
seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in
earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon
observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; every
thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance
of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the
belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom,
afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly
calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so
honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must
be vain. But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.
Lydia—the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon
swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her
handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a
pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation
by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.—But I will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This
unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.” “Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize
for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home
immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.—I know
it cannot be long.” He readily assured her of his secrecy—again
expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion
than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments
for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away. As
he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination. If gratitude and esteem are
good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be
neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise, if the regard springing
from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is
so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and
even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her
defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter
method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might
perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of
attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this
early example of what Lydia’s infamy must produce, found additional
anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading
Jane’s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to
marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such
an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this
developement. While the contents of the first letter remained on her
mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a
girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia
could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible. But now it
was all too natural. For such an attachment as this, she might have
sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be
deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of
marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor
her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had
never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had
any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only
encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one officer,
sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised
them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually fluctuating,
but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken
indulgence towards such a girl.—Oh! how acutely did she now feel it. She
was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share
with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family
so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;—but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.—Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.—Elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be
done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was
here when you sent for us;—was it so?” “Yes; and I told him we should
not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled.” “That is all
settled;” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. “And
are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that
I knew how it was!” But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to
amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had
Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain
that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but
she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest
there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with
false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the
whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account
at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after
all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time
than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to
Longbourn. IHAVE BEEN thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her
uncle, as they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious
consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your
eldest sister does of the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely,
that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no
means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his
colonel’s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he
expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be
noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?
His temptation is not adequate to the risk.” “Do you really think so?”
cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment. “Upon my word,” said
Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s opinion. It is really too
great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty
of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy,
so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?” “Not perhaps of
neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect I can believe
him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why
should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?” “In the
first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof that
they are not gone to Scotland.” “Oh! but their removing from the chaise
into an hackney-coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of
them were to be found on the Barnet road.” “Well, then—supposing them to
be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment,
for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be
very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could
be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than
in Scotland.” “But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why
must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most
particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never
intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some
money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions
has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for
her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well. As
to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw
on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I
know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to
your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do
as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such
a matter.” “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but
love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than
marriage?” “It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied
Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and
virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not
what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young;
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last
half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but
amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the
most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in
her way. Since the——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but
love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been
doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject,
to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings;
which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has
every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.” “But you
see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of Wickham, as to
believe him capable of the attempt.” “Of whom does Jane ever think ill?
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would
believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know
that he has been profligate in every sense of the word. That he has
neither integrity nor honour. That he is as false and deceitful, as he
is insinuating.” “And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner,
whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. “I do,
indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day, of his
infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.” “But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what
you and Jane seem so well to understand?” “Oh, yes!—that, that is the
worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and
his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.
And when I returned home, the——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or
fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related
the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for
of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion
which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And
even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the
necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my
head. That such a consequence as this should ensue, you may easily
believe was far enough from my thoughts.” “When they all removed to
Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond
of each other.” “Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of
affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been
perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it
could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready
enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in, or near
Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but
he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and,
consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild
admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who
treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.” It may
be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to
their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its
repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the
whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness. They travelled as expeditiously as
possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by
dinner-time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that
Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. The little
Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the
steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage
drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces,
and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and
frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. Elizabeth
jumped out; and after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into
the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her
mother’s apartment, immediately met her. Elizabeth, as she
affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost
not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the
fugitives. “Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come,
I hope every thing will be well.” “Is my father in town?” “Yes, he went
on Tuesday as I wrote you word.” “And have you heard from him often?”
“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention.” “And my
mother—How is she? How are you all?” “My mother is tolerably well, I
trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up stairs, and will
have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her
dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well.” “But
you—How are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you must
have gone through!” Her sister, however, assured her, of her being
perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an
end to, by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and
aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and
tears. When they were all in the drawing room, the questions which
Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and
they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope
of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not
yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and
that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her
father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage.
Blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing. “If I had been able,”
said she, “to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family
this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take
care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I
am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is
not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked
after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;
but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here’s
Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he
meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if
you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.” They
all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia. “Do not give way to
useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be prepared for the
worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a
week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we may gain some news
of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design
of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I
get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to
Gracechurch-street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be
done.” “Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what
I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from
fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,—that I am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear
Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.” But Mr. Gardiner,
though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause,
could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as
her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on
table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who
attended, in the absence of her daughters. Though her brother and sister
were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from
the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she
had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while
they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the
household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all
her fears and solicitude on the subject. In the dining-room they were
soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their
separate apartments, to make their appearance before. One came from her
books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were
tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the
loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself
incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than
usual, to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of
herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection,
soon after they were seated at table. “This is a most unfortunate
affair; and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide
of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of
sisterly consolation.” Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of
replying, she added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may
draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is
irretrievable—that one false step involves her in endless ruin—that her
reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,—and that she cannot
be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the
other sex.” Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much
oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself
with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them. In the
afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour
by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and every thing about it, which
I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.” “Colonel
Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially
on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for
him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming
to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of
their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got
abroad, it hastened his journey.” “And was Denny convinced that Wickham
would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel
Forster seen Denny himself?” “Yes; but when questioned by him Denny
denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real
opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not
marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been
misunderstood before.” “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one
of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”
“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a
little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks.” “But not before
they went to Brighton?” “No, I believe not.” “And did Colonel Forster
appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real
character?” “I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as
he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And
since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton
greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.” “Oh, Jane, had we been
less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have
happened!” “Perhaps it would have been better;” replied her sister. “But
to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their
present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best
intentions.” “Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s
note to his wife?” “He brought it with him for us to see.” Jane then
took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the
contents: My Dear Harriet, You will laugh when you know where I am gone,
and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as
soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess
with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him,
so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn
of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the
greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham. What a
good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my
excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to
night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him
I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I
shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would
tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they
are packed up. Good bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you
will drink to our good journey. Your affectionate friend, Lydia Bennet
“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment. But
at least it shews, that she was serious in the object of her journey.
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!” “I never
saw any one so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such
confusion!” “Oh! Jane!” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging
to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?” “I
do not know.—I hope there was.—But to be guarded at such a time, is very
difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give
her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I
might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost
took from me my faculties.” “Your attendance upon her, has been too much
for you. You do not look well. Oh! that I had been with you, you have
had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.” “Mary and Kitty have
been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I
did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate,
and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken
in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father
went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of
great use and comfort to us all, and Lady Lucas has been very kind; she
walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her
services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.” “She
had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she meant
well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of
one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.” She then
proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to
pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter. “He meant, I
believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where they last
changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made
out from them. His principal object must be, to discover the number of
the hackney-coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare
from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and
lady’s removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he
meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how discover at what
house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make
enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the
stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that
he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so
greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much
as this.” THE WHOLE PARTY were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the
next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from
him. His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent
and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for
exertion. They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing
intelligence to send, but even of that they would have been glad to be
certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel. Mrs. Gardiner and
the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the
former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She
shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to
them, in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them
frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and
heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some
fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom
went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them. All
Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them. Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his
wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he
had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to
Gracechurch-street. That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham,
before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information;
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in
town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of
them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but
as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave
London, and promised to write again very soon. There was also a
postscript to this effect: “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire
him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in
the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who
would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed
himself. If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a
probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential
consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster
will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this
head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what
relations he has now living, better than any other person.” Elizabeth
was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her
authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved. She had never
heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his companions in the——shire, might be able to give more information;
and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to. Every day at Longbourn was now a day
of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was
expected. The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every
morning’s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be
told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to
bring some news of importance. But before they heard again from
Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different
quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to
open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and
Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked
over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows: My Dear Sir, I feel
myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to
condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under,
of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be
assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise
with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress,
which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause
which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that
can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a
circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent’s
mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in
comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is
reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this
licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a
faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the
consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her
own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are
grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by
Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I
have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this
false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the
others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will
connect themselves with such a family. And this consideration leads me
moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of
last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in
all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offence. I am, dear Sir, &amp;c. &amp;c. Mr. Gardiner did
not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster;
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known
that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection,
and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former
acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it
did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of
them. There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to
give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances,
there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of
discovery by Lydia’s relations, for it had just transpired that he had
left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount. Colonel
Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to
clear his expences at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the town, but his
debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt
to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family, Jane heard them
with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had
not an idea of it.” Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might
expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was
Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their
endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law’s intreaty that he
would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion
might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When
Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction
as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had
been before. “What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!” she
cried. “Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is
to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?” As
Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and
her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came
from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn. Mrs. Gardiner went
away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend,
that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never
been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of
half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed
by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none
since her return, that could come from Pemberley. The present unhappy
state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her
spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured
from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well
acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she
known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy
somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless
night out of two. When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of
his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been
in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken
him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak
of it. It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.” “You must not be too severe upon yourself,”
replied Elizabeth. “You may well warn me against such an evil. Human
nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life
feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered
by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.” “Do you suppose them
to be in London?” “Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?” “And
Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty. “She is happy, then,”
said her father, drily; “and her residence there will probably be of
some duration.” Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I
bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May,
which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind.” They were
interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s tea. “This is
a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an elegance to
misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in
my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,—or,
perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.” “I am not going to run
away, Papa,” said Kitty, fretfully; “if I should ever go to Brighton, I
would behave better than Lydia.” “You go to Brighton!—I would not trust
you so near it as East Bourne, for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at
last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No
officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the
village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with
one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors, till you
can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational
manner.” Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to
cry. “Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a
good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end
of them.” TWO DAYS AFTER Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were
walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the
housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call
them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the
expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I
beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you
might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming
to ask.” “What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”
“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter.” Away ran the girls, too
eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule
into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;—their father was in
neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their
mother, when they were met by the butler, who said, “If you are looking
for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the little copse.” Upon this
information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran
across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his
way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock. Jane, who was not
so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged
behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and
eagerly cried out, “Oh, Papa, what news? what news? have you heard from
my uncle?” “Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.” “Well, and
what news does it bring? good or bad?” “What is there of good to be
expected?” said he, taking the letter from his pocket; “but perhaps you
would like to read it.” Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.
Jane now came up. “Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know
myself what it is about.” Gracechurch-street, Monday, August 2. “My Dear
Brother, “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and
such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after
you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part
of London they were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet. It is
enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both—” “Then it is,
as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!” Elizabeth read on;
“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was
any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my
sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions,
which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will
easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say,
there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged,
to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name,
throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give
directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will
not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore,
stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send
back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.
We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house,
of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write
again as soon as any thing more is determined on. Your’s, &amp;c. Edw.
Gardiner.” “Is it possible!” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.
“Can it be possible that he will marry her?” “Wickham is not so
undeserving, then, as we have thought him;” said her sister. “My dear
father, I congratulate you.” “And have you answered the letter?” said
Elizabeth. “No; but it must be done soon.” Most earnestly did she then
intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. “Oh! my dear father,”
she cried, “come back, and write immediately. Consider how important
every moment is, in such a case.” “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if
you dislike the trouble yourself.” “I dislike it very much,” he replied;
“but it must be done.” And so saying, he turned back with them, and
walked towards the house. “And may I ask?” said Elizabeth, “but the
terms, I suppose, must be complied with.” “Complied with! I am only
ashamed of his asking so little.” “And they must marry! Yet he is such a
man!” “Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But
there are two things that I want very much to know:—one is, how much
money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I
am ever to pay him.” “Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean,
Sir?” “I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.” “That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred
to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!
Oh! it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.” “No,” said her
father, “Wickham’s a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten
thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very
beginning of our relationship.” “Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How
is half such a sum to be repaid?” Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of
them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked
into the breakfast-room. “And they are really to be married!” cried
Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. “How strange this is! And
for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is
their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are
forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!” “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied
Jane, “that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real
regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards
clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing
like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have
more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?” “If we are ever able
to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said Elizabeth, “and how much
is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what
Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not six-pence of his
own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their
taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and
countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude
cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If
such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to
be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!” “We must
endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said Jane: “I
hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a
proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their
mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle
so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their
past imprudence forgotten.” “Their conduct has been such,” replied
Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is
useless to talk of it.” It now occurred to the girls that their mother
was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went
to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not
wish them to make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising
his head, coolly replied, “Just as you please.” “May we take my uncle’s
letter to read to her?” “Take whatever you like, and get away.”
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly
contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know
that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “This is delightful indeed!—She will
be married!—I shall see her again!—She will be married at sixteen!—My
good, kind brother!—I knew how it would be—I knew he would manage every
thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia!—How merry we shall be together when we meet!” Her eldest daughter
endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by
leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour
laid them all under. “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she
added, “in a great measure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he
has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.” “Well,” cried her
mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he
had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his
money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from
him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy. In a short time, I
shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds. And she
was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I
am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will
settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things
should be ordered immediately.” She was then proceeding to all the
particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have
dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some
difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be
consulted. One day’s delay she observed, would be of small importance;
and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other
schemes too came into her head. “I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as
soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run
down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good,
I am sure. Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes
Hill. My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to
be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her
wedding.” Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth
received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this
folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained. MR. BENNET HAD VERY often wished, before this period of his
life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an
annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife,
if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his
duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle,
for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The
satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in
Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper
place. He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage
to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his
brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the
extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he
could. When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be
perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was
to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and
the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five
daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come;
and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain
that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income. Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on
Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be
divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents. This
was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be
settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the
proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the
kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then
delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his
willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had
never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his
daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as
by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the
loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board
and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed
to her, through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expences had been very
little within that sum. That it would be done with such trifling
exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his
chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as
possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his
activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his
former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in
undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know
farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too
angry with Lydia, to send any message to her. The good news quickly
spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the
neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be
sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss
Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been
secluded from the world, in some distant farm house. But there was much
to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her
well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies
in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of
circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered
certain. It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but
on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and
in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance. “Haye-Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit
it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but
Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me;
and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.” Her husband allowed
her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained. But
when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs. Bennet, before you take
any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a
right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood, they shall
never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by
receiving them at Longbourn.” A long dispute followed this declaration;
but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found,
with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea
to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive
from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet
could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a
point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a
privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid,
exceeded all that she could believe possible. She was more alive to the
disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter’s
nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with
Wickham, a fortnight before they took place. Elizabeth was now most
heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led
to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since
her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the
elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from
all those who were not immediately on the spot. She had no fear of its
spreading farther, through his means. There were few people on whose
secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time,
there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister’s frailty would have
mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from
it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf
impossible between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on the most
honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect
himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be
added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man
whom he so justly scorned. From such a connection she could not wonder
that he should shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had
assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational
expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was
grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became
jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by
it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of
gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy
with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet. What a triumph
for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which
she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly
and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the
most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal, there must be a
triumph. She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who,
in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance. But no such happy marriage
could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really
was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of
the other, was soon to be formed in their family. How Wickham and Lydia
were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were
only brought together because their passions were stronger than their
virtue, she could easily conjecture. Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to
his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with
assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family;
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned
to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them,
that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia. “It was greatly
my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his marriage was
fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal
from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece’s.
It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the regulars; and, among his
former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist
him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General——’s
regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so
far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly, and I hope among
different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they
will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform
him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances
of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give
yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in
Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.
He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.
Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They
will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn;
and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of
seeing you all, before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be
dutifully remembered to you and her mother.—Your’s, &amp;c. E.
GARDINER.” Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of
Wickham’s removal from the——shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.
But Mrs. Bennet, was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled
in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites. “She is so fond of
Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking to send her away!
And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.
The officers may not be so pleasant in General——’s regiment.” His
daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted
into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at
first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in
wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and consequence, that
she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so
earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her
husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes. THEIR SISTER’S WEDDING
day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she
felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at——, and they were
to return in it, by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder
Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings
which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, was
wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. They came. The
family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them. Smiles
decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door;
her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious,
uneasy. Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown
open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced
her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate
smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with
an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. Their reception
from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His
countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke
him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia
was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She
turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when
at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice
of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was
a great while since she had been there. Wickham was not at all more
distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that
had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his
smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would
have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite
equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to
draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She
blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their
confusion, suffered no variation of colour. There was no want of
discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast
enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring
after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease,
which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of
them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was
recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her
sisters would not have alluded to for the world. “Only think of its
being three months,” she cried, “since I went away; it seems but a
fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in
the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea
of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be
very good fun if I was.” Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was
distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never
heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily
continued, “Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married
to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in
his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down
the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just
rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I
bowed and smiled like any thing.” Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She
got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard
them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined
them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her
mother’s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I
take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married
woman.” It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that
embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease
and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases,
and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called
“Mrs. Wickham,” by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after
dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the
two housemaids. “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to
the breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a
charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they
may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the
place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”
“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don’t
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?” “Oh, lord!
yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and
papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at
Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I
will take care to get good partners for them all.” “I should like it
beyond any thing!” said her mother. “And then when you go away, you may
leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get
husbands for them before the winter is over.” “I thank you for my share
of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not particularly like your way
of getting husbands.” Their visitors were not to remain above ten days
with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left
London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No
one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not. Wickham’s affection for Lydia, was just
what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him.
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from
the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the
strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered
why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all
had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by
distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the
young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. Lydia was
exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no
one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in
the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of
September, than any body else in the country. One morning, soon after
their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said
to Elizabeth, “Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I
believe. You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about
it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?” “No really,”
replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said on the
subject.” “La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off.
We were married you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings
were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by
eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the
others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I
was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen
to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there
was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away
just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one
word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I
longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat. “Well, and
so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over;
for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were
horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe me, I
did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was rather
thin, but however the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the
carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to
that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I
recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented going, the wedding
need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”
“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. “Oh, yes!—he was to
come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I
ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully!
What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!” “If it was to be
secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the subject. You may depend
upon my seeking no further.” “Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though
burning with curiosity; “we will ask you no questions.” “Thank you,”
said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then
Wickham would be angry.” On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was
forced to put it out of her power, by running away. But to live in
ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible
not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister’s wedding.
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had
apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to
the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was
satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct
in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such
suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to
her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were
compatible with the secrecy which had been intended. “You may readily
comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to know how a person
unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to
our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write
instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent
reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary;
and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.” “Not that I
shall, though,” she added to herself, as she finished the letter; “and
my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall
certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.” Jane’s
delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth
privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it
appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had
rather be without a confidante. ELIZABETH HAD THE satisfaction of
receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could. She
was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse,
where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the
benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter
convinced her, that it did not contain a denial. Gracechurch-street,
Sept. 6. My Dear Niece, I have just received your letter, and shall
devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little
writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself
surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don’t think
me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not
imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not
choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much
surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party
concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are
really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day
of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected
visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It
was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully
racked as your’s seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that
he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had
seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From
what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and
came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive
professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that
Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it
impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed
that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions
open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it,
therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil,
which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am
sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before
he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search,
which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this, was another
reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a
Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did
not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has
since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he
knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for
intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three
days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray
her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did
know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her,
on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them
into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At
length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They
were in——street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing
Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends
as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his
assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely
resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends,
she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She
was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much
signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he
thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first
conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt, had never been his design.
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some
debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all
the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight, on her own folly alone. He meant
to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he
could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did
not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy
asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet
was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do
something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage,
in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not
likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met
several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course
wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable. Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy’s next
step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner
could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on farther enquiry, that your
father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did
not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult
as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after
the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the
next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. On
Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and,
as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together. They met again
on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday:
as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our
visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many faults at
different times; but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that
he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be
thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily
have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which
was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But
at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to
be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the
probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really
believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it
required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and
give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther
than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what
has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting,
I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand
in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have
given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper
consideration, that Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and
consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps
there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or
anybody’s reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all
this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for
another interest in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he
returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but
it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding
took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.
I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you
tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him
in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied
with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by
Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was
exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give
you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious
manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it
was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes
quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and
for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his
return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with
us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this
opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how
much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as
pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions
all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that,
if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very
sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.
Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The
children have been wanting me this half hour. Your’s, very sincerely, M.
Gardiner. The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of
spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain
bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which
uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to
forward her sister’s match, which she had feared to encourage, as an
exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time
dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond
their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to
town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification
attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary
to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced
to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the
man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was
punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he
could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper, that he had done
it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations,
and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required
to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused
him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against
relationship with Wickham. Brother in law of Wickham! Every kind of
pride must revolt from the connection. He had to be sure done much. She
was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his
interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was
reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and
he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place
herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that
remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause
where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful,
exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a
person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of
Lydia, her character, every thing to him. Oh! how heartily did she
grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every
saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was
humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion
and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over
her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough;
but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed
with regret, on finding how stedfastly both she and her uncle had been
persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and
herself. She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some
one’s approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham. “I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my
dear sister?” said he, as he joined her. “You certainly do,” she replied
with a smile; “but it does not follow that the interruption must be
unwelcome.” “I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good
friends; and now we are better.” “True. Are the others coming out?” “I
do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.
And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have
actually seen Pemberley.” She replied in the affirmative. “I almost envy
you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else
I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper,
I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course
she did not mention my name to you.” “Yes, she did.” “And what did she
say?” “That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not
turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are
strangely misrepresented.” “Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips.
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, “I
was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.” “Perhaps preparing
for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said Elizabeth. “It must be
something particular, to take him there at this time of year.”
“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.” “Yes; he introduced us to
his sister.” “And do you like her?” “Very much.” “I have heard, indeed,
that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw
her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope
she will turn out well.” “I dare say she will; she has got over the most
trying age.” “Did you go by the village of Kympton?” “I do not recollect
that we did.” “I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to
have had. A most delightful place! Excellent Parsonage House! It would
have suited me in every respect.” “How should you have liked making
sermons?” “Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my
duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?” “I have heard from authority,
which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at
the will of the present patron.” “You have. Yes, there was something in
that; I told you so from the first, you may remember.” “I did hear, too,
that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palateable to you,
as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution
of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised
accordingly.” “You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You
may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, “Come, Mr. Wickham,
we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the
past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.” She held out
her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly
knew how to look, and they entered the house. MR. WICKHAM WAS SO
perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again
distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by
introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had
said enough to keep him quiet. The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon
came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as
her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to
Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. “Oh! my dear
Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?” “Oh, lord! I don’t know.
Not these two or three years perhaps.” “Write to me very often, my
dear.” “As often as I can. But you know married women have never much
time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing
else to do.” Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his
wife’s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things. “He is
as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the
house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.
I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself,
to produce a more valuable son-in-law.” The loss of her daughter made
Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days. “I often think,” said she, “that
there is nothing so bad as parting with one’s friends. One seems so
forlorn without them.” “This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of
marrying a daughter,” said Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied
that your other four are single.” “It is no such thing. Lydia does not
leave me because she is married; but only because her husband’s regiment
happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have
gone so soon.” But the spiritless condition which this event threw her
into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation
of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She
looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns. “Well, well,
and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs. Philips first
brought her the news.) “Well, so much the better. Not that I care about
it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to
see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield,
if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to
us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about
it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?” “You may depend on it,”
replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw
her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it;
and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at
the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher’s,
she told me, on purpose to order in some more meat on Wednesday, and she
has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed.” Miss Bennet had
not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour. It was
many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as
soon as they were alone together, she said, “I saw you look at me
to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I
appeared distressed. But don’t imagine it was from any silly cause. I
was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked
at. I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with
pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because
we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I
dread other people’s remarks.” Elizabeth did not know what to make of
it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him
capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged;
but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the
greater probability of his coming there with his friend’s permission, or
being bold enough to come without it. “Yet it is hard,” she sometimes
thought, “that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has
legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to
himself.” In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to
be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could
easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more
disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. The subject which
had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth
ago, was now brought forward again. “As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes,
my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you will wait on him of course.” “No, no.
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see
him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I
will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.” His wife represented to him
how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the
neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield. “’Tis an
etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let him seek
it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after
my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again.” “Well, all
I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.
But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am
determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.” Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before they
did. As the day of his arrival drew near, “I begin to be sorry that he
comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It would be nothing; I could
see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus
perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no
one can know how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be,
when his stay at Netherfield is over!” “I wish I could say any thing to
comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it is wholly out of my power. You
must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a
sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.” Mr. Bingley
arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to
have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and
fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could. She counted the
days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless
of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in
Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the
paddock, and ride towards the house. Her daughters were eagerly called
to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but
Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw
Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister. “There is a
gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?” “Some
acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.”
“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what’s his name. That tall, proud man.” “Good gracious!
Mr. Darcy!—and so it does I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley’s will
always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the
very sight of him.” Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt
for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost
for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters
were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for
themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and
her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without
being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness
which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had
courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of
sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals
she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own
more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family
were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself
with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and
just, as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at
his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her
again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his
altered behaviour in Derbyshire. The colour which had been driven from
her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a
smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space
of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she
would not be secure. “Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it
will then be early enough for expectation.” She sat intently at work,
striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till
anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant
was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but
more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing,
her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and
with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of
resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance. Elizabeth said as little to
either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an
eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one
glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he
had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at
Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s presence be what he
was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable,
conjecture. Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that
short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was
received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two
daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and
ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied. Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a
question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any
thing. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his
silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to
her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes
elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally,
unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his
face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and
frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less
anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She
was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so. “Could I expect
it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?” She was in no
humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had
hardly courage to speak. She enquired after his sister, but could do no
more. “It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said
Mrs. Bennet. He readily agreed to it. “I began to be afraid you would
never come back again. People did say, you meant to quit the place
entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great
many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.
Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I
suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the
papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not
put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham,
Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said of her
father, or the place where she lived, or any thing. It was my brother
Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an
awkward business of it. Did you see it?” Bingley replied that he did,
and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How
Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. “It is a delightful
thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued her
mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her
taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite
northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving
the——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he
has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.” Elizabeth,
who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame,
that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the
exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before;
and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country
at present. A few weeks, he believed. “When you have killed all your own
birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother, “I beg you will come here, and
shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be
vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for
you.” Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion. “The first wish of my heart,” said
she to herself, “is never more to be in company with either of them.
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such
wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!”
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent. When the gentlemen
rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and
they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.
“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement.” Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and
said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.
They then went away. Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them
to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very
good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be
good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy
the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year. AS SOON AS
THEY were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other
words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden
them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her. “Why, if he
came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she, “did he come
at all?” She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. “He could
be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in
town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no
longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no
more about him.” Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept
by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look,
which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.” “Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth,
laughingly. “Oh, Jane, take care.” “My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me
so weak, as to be in danger now.” “I think you are in very great danger
of making him as much in love with you as ever.” They did not see the
gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was
giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common
politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had revived. On Tuesday
there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were
most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her. Elizabeth, with a triumphant
sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble
indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his
sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards
Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm. His behaviour to
her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her,
which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if
left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily
secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet
received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the
animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful
humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide
them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a
situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family. She was in hopes that the evening would afford some
opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would
not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of
conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his
entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the
drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a
degree, that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their
entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the
evening must depend. “If he does not come to me, then,” said she, “I
shall give him up for ever.” The gentlemen came; and she thought he
looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had
crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth
pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a
single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair. And on the
gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever,
and said, in a whisper, “The men shan’t come and part us, I am
determined. We want none of them; do we?” Darcy had walked away to
another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied every
one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to
coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! “A man
who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect
a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest
against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is
no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!” She was a little revived,
however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the
opportunity of saying, “Is your sister at Pemberley still?” “Yes, she
will remain there till Christmas.” “And quite alone? Have all her
friends left her?” “Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone
on to Scarborough, these three weeks.” She could think of nothing more
to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better
success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at
last, on the young lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them. “Well girls,” said
she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What say you to the day?
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The
dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to
a turn—and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was
fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas’s last week; and even
Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done;
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear
Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for
I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides?
‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.’ She did
indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her
nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like
them prodigiously.” Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits;
she had seen enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that
she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her
family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was
quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make
his proposals. “It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to
Elizabeth. “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the
other. I hope we may often meet again.” Elizabeth smiled. “Lizzy, you
must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you
that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and
sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly
satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of
engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater
sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than
any other man.” “You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let
me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.” “How hard it is in
some cases to be believed!” “And how impossible in others!” “But why
should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?”
“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”
A FEW DAYS AFTER this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. “Next
time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.” He should be
particularly happy at any time, &amp;c. &amp;c; and if she would give
him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them. “Can you
come to-morrow?” Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her
invitation was accepted with alacrity. He came, and in such very good
time, that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to
her daughter’s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half
finished, crying out, “My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is
come—Mr. Bingley is come.—He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here,
Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.
Never mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.” “We will be down as soon as we can,” said
Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went
up stairs half an hour ago.” “Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with
it? Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?” But when her
mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one
of her sisters. The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible
again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as
was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles
of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?” “Nothing child, nothing. I
did not wink at you.” She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable
to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to
Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the
room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress
at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give into it.
In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,
“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.” Elizabeth was forced to go.
“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing room.” Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother,
but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight,
then returned into the drawing room. Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day
were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the
professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him
a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the
ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks
with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to
the daughter. He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and
before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own
and Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her
husband. After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a
word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went
to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless
Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt
tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that
gentleman’s concurrence. Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he
and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The
latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was
nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his
ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative,
and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course
returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention
was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for
that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit
down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother’s
schemes. But on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was
finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear
that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she
perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as
if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each
other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but
her’s she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either;
and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the others had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room. Jane could have no reserves
from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly
embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was
the happiest creature in the world. “’Tis too much!” she added, “by far
too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not every body as happy.”
Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present. “I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I
would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or
allow her to hear it from any one but myself. He is gone to my father
already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such
pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!” She
then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card
party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty. Elizabeth, who was left by
herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was
finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense
and vexation. “And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s
anxious circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance!
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!” In a few minutes she was
joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and
to the purpose. “Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened
the door. “With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare
say.” He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good
wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily
expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook
hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had
to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane’s
perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really
believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded,
because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and
super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling
and taste between her and himself. It was an evening of no common
delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow
of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than
ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.
Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in
terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley
of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at
supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was. Not
a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor
took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to
his daughter and said, “Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very
happy woman.” Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him
for his goodness. “You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great
pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt
of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike.
You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on;
so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you
will always exceed your income.” “I hope not so. Imprudence or
thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in me.” “Exceed
their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you talking
of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more.”
Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I
am sure I sha’nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be.
I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so
beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he
first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!” Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond
competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other.
Her youngest sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of
happiness which she might in future be able to dispense. Mary petitioned
for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard
for a few balls there every winter. Bingley, from this time, was of
course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast,
and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous
neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation
to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept. Elizabeth had now
but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was
present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found
herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always
attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and
when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not
believed it possible.” “I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But
how did he account for it?” “It must have been his sister’s doing. They
were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot
wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in
many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their
brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall
be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each
other.” “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I
ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you
again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.” “Would you believe
it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me,
and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent, would have
prevented his coming down again!” “He made a little mistake to be sure;
but it is to the credit of his modesty.” This naturally introduced a
panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on
his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not
betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most
generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a
circumstance which must prejudice her against him. “I am certainly the
most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why
am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could
but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!” “If
you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.” The situation
of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.
Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and she
ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours
in Meryton. The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest
family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had
first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for
misfortune. ONE MORNING, ABOUT a week after Bingley’s engagement with
Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting
together in the dining room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the
window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four
driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and
besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the
servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain,
however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss
Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with
him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the
remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the
door was thrown open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine
de Bourgh. They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of
Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt. She entered the room with an air more
than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation,
than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a
word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship’s
entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. Mrs. Bennet
all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high
importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a
moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, “I hope you are
well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother.” Elizabeth
replied very concisely that she was. “And that I suppose is one of your
sisters.” “Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady
Catherine. “She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is
lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking
with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family.”
“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence. “It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.” “This must
be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the
windows are full west.” Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat
there after dinner; and then added, “May I take the liberty of asking
your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.” “Yes, very
well. I saw them the night before last.” Elizabeth now expected that she
would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only
probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was
completely puzzled. Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her
ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely,
and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up,
said to Elizabeth, “Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of
a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a
turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.” “Go, my dear,”
cried her mother, “and shew her ladyship about the different walks. I
think she will be pleased with the hermitage.” Elizabeth obeyed, and
running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down
stairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors
into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a
short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on. Her carriage
remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in
it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the
copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with
a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. “How
could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in her
face. As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the
following manner:— “You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand
the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience,
must tell you why I come.” Elizabeth looked with unaffected
astonishment. “Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all
able to account for the honour of seeing you here.” “Miss Bennet,”
replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to know, that I am
not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you
shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its
sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall
certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature,
reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your sister was on
the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss
Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to
my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a
scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to
suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off
for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.” “If you
believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring with
astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming so
far. What could your ladyship propose by it?” “At once to insist upon
having such a report universally contradicted.” “Your coming to
Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth, coolly, “will be
rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.”
“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?” “I never heard that it was.” “And can you
likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?” “I do not pretend
to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions,
which I shall not choose to answer.” “This is not to be borne. Miss
Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an
offer of marriage?” “Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.” “If I have, I shall be the last person to
confess it.” “Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been
accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he
has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
“But you are not entitled to know mine, nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit.” “Let me be rightly understood. This
match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take
place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you
to say?” “Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose
he will make an offer to me.” Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and
then replied, “The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From
their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the
favourite wish of his mother, as well as of her’s. While in their
cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of
both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented
by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and
wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his
friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to
every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that
from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?” “Yes, and I had
heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection
to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by
knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You
both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage. Its completion
depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination
confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I
am that choice, why may not I accept him?” “Because honour, decorum,
prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do
not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act
against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and
despised, by every one connected with him. Your alliance will be a
disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.” “These
are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr. Darcy
must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached
to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to
repine.” “Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your
gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on
that score? “Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I
came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor
will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any
person’s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking
disappointment.” “That will make your ladyship’s situation at present
more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.” “I will not be
interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed
for each other. They are descended on the maternal side, from the same
noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable, honourable, and
ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both sides is
splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member
of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart
pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is
this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible
of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you
have been brought up.” “In marrying your nephew, I should not consider
myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s
daughter; so far we are equal.” “True. You are a gentleman’s daughter.
But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine
me ignorant of their condition.” “Whatever my connections may be,” said
Elizabeth, “if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing
to you.” “Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?” Though
Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine,
have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment’s
deliberation, “I am not.” Lady Catherine seemed pleased. “And will you
promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?” “I will make no
promise of the kind.” “Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I
expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive
yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away,
till you have given me the assurance I require.” “And I certainly never
shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly
unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but
would my giving you the wished-for promise, make their marriage at all
more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to
accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to
say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported
this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the
application was ill judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.” “Not so hasty,
if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have
already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the
particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous elopement. I know it all;
that the young man’s marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the
expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew’s
sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father’s steward, to be
his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?” “You can now have nothing farther to
say,” she resentfully answered. “You have insulted me, in every possible
method. I must beg to return to the house.” And she rose as she spoke.
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly
incensed. “You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my
nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection
with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?” “Lady Catherine,
I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments.” “You are then
resolved to have him?” “I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to
act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my
happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly
unconnected with me.” “It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You
refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are
determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him
the contempt of the world.” “Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,”
replied Elizabeth, “have any possible claim on me, in the present
instance. No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with
Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the
indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me,
it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the world in general would
have too much sense to join in the scorn.” “And this is your real
opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to
act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be
gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend
upon it I will carry my point.” In this manner Lady Catherine talked on,
till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round,
she added, “I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments
to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously
displeased.” Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to
persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it
herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room, to ask
why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself. “She did
not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.” “She is a very
fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she
only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her
road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she
might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say
to you, Lizzy?” Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood
here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was
impossible. THE DISCOMPOSURE OF spirits, which this extraordinary visit
threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for
many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine
it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from
Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement
with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the
report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to
imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of
Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when
the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to
supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage
of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her
neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication
with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached Lady Catherine)
had only set that down, as almost certain and immediate, which she had
looked forward to as possible, at some future time. In resolving Lady
Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some
uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this
interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their
marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application
to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the
evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She
knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his
dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he
thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was
certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose
immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address
him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably
feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and
ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning. If he had
been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed
likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every
doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished
could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine
might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of
coming again to Netherfield must give way. “If, therefore, an excuse for
not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days,”
she added, “I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over
every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with
only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand,
I shall soon cease to regret him at all.” The surprise of the rest of
the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but
they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which
had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much
teazing on the subject. The next morning, as she was going down stairs,
she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in
his hand. “Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my
room.” She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had
to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some
manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations. She followed her father to the fire place, and
they both sat down. He then said, “I have received a letter this morning
that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself,
you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two
daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very
important conquest.” The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in
the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,
instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased
that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not
rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, “You look
conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these;
but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your
admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.” “From Mr. Collins! and what
can he have to say?” “Something very much to the purpose of course. He
begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest
daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the
good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience,
by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as
follows. ‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of
Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint
on the subject of another, of which we have been advertised by the same
authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear
the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the
chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of
the most illustrious personages in this land.’ “Can you possibly guess,
Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young gentleman is blessed in a
peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most
desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet
in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and
yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with
this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to
take immediate advantage of.’ “Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this
gentleman is? But now it comes out.” “‘My motive for cautioning you, is
as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.’ “Mr. Darcy, you
see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or
the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our
acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to
what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a
blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is
admirable!” Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but
could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been
directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. “Are you not diverted?”
“Oh! yes. Pray read on.” “‘After mentioning the likelihood of this
marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual
condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became
apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my
cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so
disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest
intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be
aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which
has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am
truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well
hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the
marriage took place, should be so generally known. I must not, however,
neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my
amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house
as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I
been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit
them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your
hearing.’ That is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his
letter is only about his dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation
of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy
it. You are not going to be Missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted
at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our
neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?” “Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am
excessively diverted. But it is so strange!” “Yes—that is what makes it
amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but
his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so
delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up
Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a
letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over
Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she
call to refuse her consent?” To this question his daughter replied only
with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she
was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at
a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary
to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly
mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference, and she
could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that
perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too
much. INSTEAD OF RECEIVING any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy,
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same. They
walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and
as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty
left them, she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her
resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she
immediately said, “Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the
sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be
wounding your’s. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled
kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most
anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to
the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to
express.” “I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of
surprise and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in
a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think
Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.” “You must not blame my aunt.
Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned
in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the
particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my
family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much
trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering
them.” “If you will thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself
alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the
other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only
of you.” Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short
pause, her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If
your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will
silence me on this subject for ever.” Elizabeth feeling all the more
than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself
to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to
understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change,
since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with
gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The happiness which this
reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he
expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man
violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to
encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of
heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she
could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in
proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every
moment more valuable. They walked on, without knowing in what direction.
There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to
any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their
present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on
him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to
Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with
Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter,
which, in her ladyship’s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her
perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must
assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which she
had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had
been exactly contrariwise. “It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had
scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your
disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably
decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,
frankly and openly.” Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied,
“Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in
abusing you to all your relations.” “What did you say of me, that I did
not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on
mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the
severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without
abhorrence.” “We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed
to that evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope,
improved in civility.” “I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The
recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my
expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,
inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall
never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner.’ Those
were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have
tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable
enough to allow their justice.” “I was certainly very far from expecting
them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of
their being ever felt in such a way.” “I can easily believe it. You
thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The
turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could
not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to
accept me.” “Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections
will not do at all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily
ashamed of it.” Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it
soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any
credit to its contents?” She explained what its effect on her had been,
and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed. “I knew,”
said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I
hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the
opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading
again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate
me.” “The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential
to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to
think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite
so easily changed as that implies.” “When I wrote that letter,” replied
Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since
convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.” “The
letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu
is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the
person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely
different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my
philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.” “I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the
contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much
better, of ignorance. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections
will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been
a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a
child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my
temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only child) I
was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my
own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still
have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe
you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a
doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.” “Had you then
persuaded yourself that I should?” “Indeed I had. What will you think of
my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.” “My
manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you. I
never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
How you must have hated me after that evening?” “Hate you! I was angry
perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.”
“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?” “No indeed; I felt nothing but
surprise.” “Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being
noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary
politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my
due.” “My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to shew you, by every
civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and
I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by
letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any
other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in
about half an hour after I had seen you.” He then told her of
Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at
its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that
interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from
Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the
inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no
other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend. She expressed
her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be
dwelt on farther. After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and
too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining
their watches, that it was time to be at home. “What could become of
Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which introduced the discussion of
their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had
given him the earliest information of it. “I must ask whether you were
surprised?” said Elizabeth. “Not at all. When I went away, I felt that
it would soon happen.” “That is to say, you had given your permission. I
guessed as much.” And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it
had been pretty much the case. “On the evening before my going to
London,” said he, “I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought
to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my
former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent. His surprise
was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him,
moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done,
that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive
that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their
happiness together.” Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner
of directing his friend. “Did you speak from your own observation,” said
she, “when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my
information last spring?” “From the former. I had narrowly observed her
during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced
of her affection.” “And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried
immediate conviction to him.” “It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly
modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment
in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I
was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly,
offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had
been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and
purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded,
lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister’s
sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.” Elizabeth longed to
observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily
guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She
remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather
too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of
course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation
till they reached the house. In the hall they parted. MY DEAR LIZZY,
where can you have been walking to?” was a question which Elizabeth
received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the
others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that
they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She
coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a
suspicion of the truth. The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any
thing extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the
unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which
happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused,
rather knew that she was happy, than felt herself to be so; for, besides
the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She
anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became
known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared
that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and
consequence might do away. At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though
suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was
absolutely incredulous here. “You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot
be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to
be impossible.” “This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence
was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still
loves me, and we are engaged.” Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh,
Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.” “You know nothing
of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love
him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is
unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.”
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth. “Good Heaven! can it be really so!
Yet now I must believe you,” cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I
do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you
quite certain that you can be happy with him?” “There can be no doubt of
that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest
couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have
such a brother?” “Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or
myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as
impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do
any thing rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that
you feel what you ought to do?” “Oh, yes! You will only think I feel
more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.” “What do you mean?” “Why,
I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid
you will be, angry.” “My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk
very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without
delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?” “It has been
coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe
I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”
Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
farther to wish. “Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as
happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but
his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s
friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more
dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I
owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you.” Elizabeth told her
the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley;
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid
the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her,
his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night
spent in conversation. “Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood
at a window the next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not
coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so
tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a
shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.
What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that
he may not be in Bingley’s way.” Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at
so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be
always giving him such an epithet. As soon as they entered, Bingley
looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left
no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud,
“Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose
her way again to-day.” “I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said
Mrs. Bennet, “to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long
walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.” “It may do very well for
the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am sure it will be too much for
Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and
Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready,
Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying, “I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you
should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I
hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know; and
there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So,
do not put yourself to inconvenience.” During their walk, it was
resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be asked in the course of the
evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother’s.
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting
whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her
abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the
match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner
would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no
more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than
the first vehemence of her disapprobation. In the evening, soon after
Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and
follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear
her father’s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that
it should be through her means, that she, his favourite child, should be
distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and
regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in
misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a
little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table
where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her
work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he wants you in the
library.” She was gone directly. Her father was walking about the room,
looking grave and anxious. “Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are
you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always
hated him?” How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had
been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have
spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly
awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with
some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy. “Or in other words, you
are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have
more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you
happy?” “Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your
belief of my indifference?” “None at all. We all know him to be a proud,
unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked
him.” “I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I
love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You
do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of
him in such terms.” “Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my
consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare
refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if
you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of
it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither
happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless
you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you
in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you
unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.” Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her
reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really
the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.” To complete the favourable
impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for
Lydia. He heard her with astonishment. “This is an evening of wonders,
indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the
money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him his commission! So much the
better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your
uncle’s doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young
lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him
to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will
be an end of the matter.” He then recollected her embarrassment a few
days before, on his reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at
her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the
room, “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am
quite at leisure.” Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy
weight; and, after half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she
was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was
too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was
no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and
familiarity would come in time. When her mother went up to her
dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important
communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing
it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was
it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard;
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of
her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She
began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit
down again, wonder, and bless herself. “Good gracious! Lord bless me!
only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it
really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be!
What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane’s is
nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming
man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my
having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear,
dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three
daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of
me. I shall go distracted.” This was enough to prove that her
approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an
effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had
been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her. “My dearest
child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year,
and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You
must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love,
tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it
to-morrow.” This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the
gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the
certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her
relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the
morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily
stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to
speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or
mark her deference for his opinion. Elizabeth had the satisfaction of
seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and
Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.
“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as
Jane’s.” ELIZABETH’S SPIRITS SOON rising to playfulness again, she
wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.
“How could you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on
charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you
off in the first place?” “I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the
look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was
in the middle before I knew that I had begun.” “My beauty you had early
withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to you was at least always
bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather
wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for
my impertinence?” “For the liveliness of your mind, I did.” “You may as
well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is,
that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking,
and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you,
because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable you would
have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise
yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart,
you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.
There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all
things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure,
you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall
in love.” “Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane,
while she was ill at Netherfield?” “Dearest Jane! who could have done
less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities
are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as
possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing
and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly
by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined
here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not
care about me?” “Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no
encouragement.” “But I was embarrassed.” “And so was I.” “You might have
talked to me more when you came to dinner.” “A man who had felt less,
might.” “How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,
and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long
you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking
you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I
am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a
breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject? This
will never do.” “You need not distress yourself. The moral will be
perfectly fair. Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate
us, were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my
present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I
was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your’s. My aunt’s
intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know
every thing.” “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to
make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you
come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be
embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?” “My real
purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever
hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was
to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she
were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.” “Shall you
ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?”
“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly.” “And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by
you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once
did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.” From an
unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been
over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s long
letter, but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most
welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had
already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:
I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But now suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy,
indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more
than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going
to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the
ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the
happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world,
that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at
Christmas. Your’s, &amp;c. Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine, was in
a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet
sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last. Dear Sir, I must trouble you
once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of
Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were
you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give. Your’s sincerely,
&amp;c Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved. The joy which Miss
Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her
brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to
contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by
her sister. Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any
congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard
that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of
this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor
was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to
make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from
the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to
herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without
mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all
this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to
the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time
when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either,
to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.
HAPPY FOR ALL her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley and talked of Mrs. Darcy may be guessed.
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly. Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his
affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could
do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least
expected. Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a
twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was
not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The
darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a
neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition
to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each
other. Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her
time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had
generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so
ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of
Lydia’s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less
irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther
disadvantage of Lydia’s society she was of course carefully kept, and
though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her,
with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent
to her going. Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she
was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by
Mrs. Bennet’s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix
more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning
visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her
sisters’ beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she
submitted to the change without much reluctance. As for Wickham and
Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her
sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now
become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had
before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly
without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her
marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by
himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect: My
Dear Lizzy, I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do
my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have
you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think
of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do
not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some
help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but
however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
Your’s, &amp;c. As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not; she
endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and
expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to
afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own
private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident
to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons
so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very
insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters,
either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little
assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even
when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in
the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a
cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection
for her soon sunk into indifference; her’s lasted a little longer; and
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never
receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him
farther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when
her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the
Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley’s
good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving
them a hint to be gone. Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by
Darcy’s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of
visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than
ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid
off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth. Pemberley was now Georgiana’s
home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped
to see. They were able to love each other, even as well as they
intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on
alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He,
who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her
affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received
knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth’s
instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties
with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more
than ten years younger than himself. Lady Catherine was extremely
indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the
genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which
announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive,
especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an
end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he was prevailed on to
overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little
farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way,
either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife
conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in
spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from
the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt
from the city. With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate
terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were
both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by
bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them. |</p>

<td align="left">IT IS A TRUTH universally acknowledged, that a single
man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However
little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first
entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of
the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his
lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at
last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she;
“for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer. “Do not you want to know who has taken it?”
cried his wife impatiently. “You want to tell me, and I have no
objection to hearing it.” This was invitation enough. “Why, my dear, you
must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of
large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in
a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it
that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.” “Is he
married or single?” “Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of
large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our
girls!” “How so? how can it affect them?” “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied
his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking
of his marrying one of them.” “Is that his design in settling here?”
“Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may
go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still
better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might
like you the best of the party.” “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly
have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing
extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought
to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “In such cases, a woman has
not often much beauty to think of.” “But, my dear, you must indeed go
and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “It is more
than I engage for, I assure you.” “But consider your daughters. Only
think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and
Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general
you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be
impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.” “You are over scrupulous
surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will
send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his
marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a
good word for my little Lizzy.” “I desire you will do no such thing.
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half
so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are
always giving her the preference.” “They have none of them much to
recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other
girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”
“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take
delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.” “You
mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my
old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
twenty years at least.” “Ah! you do not know what I suffer.” “But I hope
you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a
year come into the neighbourhood.” “It will be no use to us, if twenty
such should come since you will not visit them.” “Depend upon it, my
dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.” Mr. Bennet was
so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice,
that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to
make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to
develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and
uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace
was visiting and news. MR. BENNET WAS AMONG the earliest of those who
waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to
the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the
evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was
then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter
employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, “I hope
Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.” “We are not in a way to know what
Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are not to
visit.” “But you forget, mama,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him
at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.” “I
do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
her.” “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you
do not depend on her serving you.” Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any
reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her
daughters. “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a
little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.” “Kitty has no
discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.” “I do
not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is your
next ball to be, Lizzy?” “To-morrow fortnight.” “Aye, so it is,” cried
her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so,
it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know
him herself.” “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend,
and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.” “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible,
when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?” “I
honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very
little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long
and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think
it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on
myself.” The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,
“Nonsense, nonsense!” “What can be the meaning of that emphatic
exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and
the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with
you there. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep
reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.” Mary wished
to say something very sensible, but knew not how. “While Mary is
adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.” “I
am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife. “I am sorry to hear that; but
why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning,
I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I
have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of
Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of
joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all
the while. “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I
should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.” “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you
chuse,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued
with the raptures of his wife. “What an excellent father you have,
girls,” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will
ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At
our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new
acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.
Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will
dance with you at the next ball.” “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not
afraid; for though I am the youngest, I’m the tallest.” The rest of the
evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s
visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. NOT ALL THAT
Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could
ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any
satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various
ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant
surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last
obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady
Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted
with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable,
and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large
party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a
certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of
Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained. “If I can but see one of my
daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her
husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing
to wish for.” In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and
sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes
of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. An invitation
to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet
planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an
answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in
town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of
their invitation, &amp;c. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could
not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his
arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always
flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield
as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the
idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball;
and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies
and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over
such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by
hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from
London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the
assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether, Mr. Bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend. Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all
the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced
every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of
giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters. Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged,
by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during
part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to
overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the
dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. “Come, Darcy,”
said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by
yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.” “I certainly
shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted
with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room,
whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.” “I would not
be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a kingdom! Upon my
honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have
this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.”
“You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said
Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. “Oh! she is the most
beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters
sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very
agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” “Which do you
mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till
catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, “She is
tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at
present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other
men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you
are wasting your time with me.” Mr. Bingley followed his advice.
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial
feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among
her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted
in any thing ridiculous. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to
the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired
by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she
had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by
this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt
Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the
most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had
been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that
they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in
good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which
they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up.
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he
had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had
raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his
wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found
that he had a very different story to hear. “Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as
she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most
excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing
could be like it. Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley
thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of
that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only
creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked
Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however,
he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he
seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he
enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two
next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth
with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth
with Lizzy, and the Boulanger.” “If he had had any compassion for me,”
cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much!
For God’s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained
his ancle in the first dance!” “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I
am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his
sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw any thing more
elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy. “But I can assure
you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his
fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth
pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He
walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not
handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to
have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.” WHEN JANE
AND ELIZABETH were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her
praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she
admired him. “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she,
“sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so
much ease, with such perfect good breeding!” “He is also handsome,”
replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be, if he
possibly can. His character is thereby complete.” “I was very much
flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such
a compliment.” “Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great
difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me
never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could
not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other
woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he
certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have
liked many a stupider person.” “Dear Lizzy!” “Oh! you are a great deal
too apt you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in
any body. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never
heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.” “I would wish not to
be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.” “I know
you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to
be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation
of candour is common enough;—one meets it every where. But to be candid
without ostentation or design—to take the good of every body’s character
and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you
alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters too, do you? Their manners
are not equal to his.” “Certainly not; at first. But they are very
pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with
her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not
find a very charming neighbour in her.” Elizabeth listened in silence,
but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been
calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation
and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too
unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to
approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good
humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where
they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had
been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a
fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more
than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were
therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and
meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of
England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than
that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.—Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase. His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his
own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley
was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst,
who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to
consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not
been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental
recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into
it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship,
in spite of a great opposition of character.—Bingley was endeared to
Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no
disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with
his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s
regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest
opinion. In understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no
means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offence. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly
was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter
people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and
attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon
felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be
so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a
sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss
Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt
authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. WITHIN A
SHORT WALK of longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were
particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in
Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour
of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty. The
distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him
courteous. Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to
be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.—They had several children. The
eldest of them a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth’s intimate friend. That the Miss Lucases and the Miss
Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and
the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear
and to communicate. “You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said
Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “You were
Mr. Bingley’s first choice.” “Yes;—but he seemed to like his second
better.” “Oh!—you mean Jane, I suppose—because he danced with her twice.
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he
did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about
Mr. Robinson.” “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and
Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how
he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were
a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the
prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question—Oh! the
eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that
point.” “Upon my word!—Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem
as if—but however, it may all come to nothing you know.” “My
overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.” “I beg you would not put
it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a
disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.
Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour
without once opening his lips.” “Are you quite sure, Ma’am?—is not there
a little mistake?” said Jane.—“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to
her.” “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and
he could not help answering her;—but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to.” “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never
speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is
remarkably agreeable.” “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he
had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can
guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I
dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,
and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.” “I do not mind his not
talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I wish he had danced with
Eliza.” “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with
him, if I were you.” “I believe, Ma’am, I may safely promise you never
to dance with him.” “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so
much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot
wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing
in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it,
he has a right to be proud.” “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth,
“and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” “If I were
as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, “I
should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and
drink a bottle of wine every day.” “Then you would drink a great deal
more than you ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it
I should take away your bottle directly.” The boy protested that she
should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument
ended only with the visit. THE LADIES OF Longbourn soon waited on those
of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s
pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley;
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger
sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with
them, was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was
received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw
superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even
her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such
as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence
of their brother’s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they
met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane
was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him
from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she
considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the
world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a
composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would
guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to
her friend Miss Lucas. “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte,
“to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes
a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection
with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity
of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the
world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in
almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We
can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there
are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” “But she
does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive
her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it
too.” “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you
do.” “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to
conceal it, he must find it out.” “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of
her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for
many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed
parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in
conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half
hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him,
there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.” “Your
plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question
but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a
rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these
are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot
even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character</td>

<td align="left">CHAPTER I. Loomings. Call me Ishmael. Some years
ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse,
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail
about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have
of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I
find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before
coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately
stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats
off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is
my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Catoa
throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is
nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
towards the ocean with me. There now is your insular city of the
Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral
reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets
take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the Battery, where that
noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours
previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers
there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from
Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the
town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean
reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the
pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward
peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and
plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then
is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here? But look! here
come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for
a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of
the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not
suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can
without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.
Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and
avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me,
does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those
ships attract them thither? Once more. Say, you are in the country; in
some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one
it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the
stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be
plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet
a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in
all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American
desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with
a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water
are wedded forever. But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the
dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape
in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs?
There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a
crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his
cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into
distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of
mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies
thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like
leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the
shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the
Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep
among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting? —Water—there is not a
drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you
travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of
Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate
whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in
a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy
boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go
to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel
such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were
now out of sight of land. Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity,b and own brother of Jove?
Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of
that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting,
mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But
that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the
image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin
to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,
I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but
a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get
sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves
much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I
am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a
Captain, or a cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices
to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honourable
respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It
is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care
of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as
cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being
a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling
fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically
salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully,
not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of
the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and
roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in
their huge bake-houses the pyramids. No, when I go to sea, I go as a
simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle,
aloft there to the royal masthead. True, they rather order me about
some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May
meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It
touches one’s sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old
established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or
Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand
into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster,
making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen
one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a
strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear
it.2 But even this wears off in time. What of it, if some old hunks of a
sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does
that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New
Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less
of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that
particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,
however the old sea-captains may order me about—however they may thump
and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all
right: that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same
way—either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so
the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each
other’s shoulder-blades, and be content. Again, I always go to sea as a
sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas
they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the
contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the
difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying
is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard
thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,—what will compare with it? The
urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous,
considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all
earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah!
how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition! Finally, I always go
to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of
the forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more
prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the
Pythagorean maximc), so for the most part the Commodore on the
quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second-hand from the sailors on the
forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same
way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the
same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that
after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now
take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible
police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me,
and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way—he can
better answer than anyone else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling
voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn
up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo
between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the
bill must have run something like this:“Grand Contested Election for the
Presidency of the United States. “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY
BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.” Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that
those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a
whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high
tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts
in farces—though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I
recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the
springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various
disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides
cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own
unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment. Chief among these motives
was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous
and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and
distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable,
nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a
thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.
With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements;
but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things
remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not
ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still
be social with it—would they let me—since it is but well to be on
friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in. By
reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and, in the wild conceits
that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost
soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one
grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air. CHAPTER II. The
Carpet-Bag. I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it
under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the
good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was on a
Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that
the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of
reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday. As most
young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this
same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be
related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made
up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine
boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old
island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of
late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in
this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was
her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the first
dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did
those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to
give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that
first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
cobble-stones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?
Now having a night, a day, and still another night, following before me
in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a
matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a
very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had
sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,
wherever you go, Ishmael, said I, to myself as I stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire
the price, and don’t be too particular. With halting steps I paced the
streets, and passed the sign of “The Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too
expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows of
the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to
have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for
everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard,
asphaltic pavement, —rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against
the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles
of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly,
again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the
street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on,
Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from before the door;
your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct
followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were
the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns. Such dreary streets! blocks of
blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like
a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last
day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But
presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building,
the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if
it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing
I did was to stumble over an ashbox in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as
the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that
destroyed city, Gomorrah?d But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The
Sword-Fish?”—this, then, must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However,
I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened
a second, interior door. It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in
Tophet.e A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and
beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a
negro church; and the preacher’s text was about the blackness of
darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha,
Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of
“The Trap!” Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of out-hanging light
not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and
looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon
it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these
words underneath—“The Spouter-Inn:—Peter Coffin.” Coffin?—Spouter?
Rather ominous in that particular connection, thought I. But it is a
common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an
emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the
time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house
itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of
some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken
sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap
lodgings, and the best of pea coffee. It was a queer sort of place—a
gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over
sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind
Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul’s
tossed craft. Euroclydon,f nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to
any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In
judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,” says an old
writer—of whose works I possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a
marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass
window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest
it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of
which the wight Death is the only glazier.” True enough, thought I, as
this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well.
Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a
pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust
in a little lint here and there. But it’s too late to make any
improvements now. The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the
chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor Lazarusg there,
chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking
off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with
rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out
the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red
silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine
frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of
their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the
privilege of making my own summer with my own coals. But what thinks
Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand
northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would
he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator;
yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this
frost? Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone
before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg
should be moored to one of the Moluccas.h Yet Dives himself, he too
lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a
president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of
orphans. But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and
there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our
frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.
CHAPTER III. The Spouter-Inn. Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you
found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On
one side hung a very large oil-painting so thoroughly be-smoked, and
every way defaced, that in the unequal cross-lights by which you viewed
it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to
it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive
at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades
and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young
artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavoured to
delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest
contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing
open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come
to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be
altogether unwarranted. But what most puzzled and confounded you was a
long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre
of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive
a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what
that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas!
deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight
gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements. —It’s a
blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of
the ice-bound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to
that one portentous something in the picture’s midst. That once found
out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint
resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself? In
fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly
based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I
conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a
great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three
dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to
spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself
upon the three mast-heads. The opposite wall of this entry was hung all
over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were
thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were
tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast
handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a
long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what
monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting
with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty
old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were
storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty
years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a
sunset. And that harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan
seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape
of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless
needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and
at last was found imbedded in the hump. Crossing this dusky entry, and
on through yon low-arched way—cut through what in old times must have
been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round—you enter the
public room. A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous
beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost
fancy you trod some old craft’s cockpits, especially of such a howling
night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one
side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked
glass-cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world’s
remotest nooks. Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a
darklooking den—the bar—a rude attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that
how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so
wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves,
ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of
swift destruction, like another cursed Jonahi (by which name indeed they
called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money,
dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death. Abominable are the
tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true cylinders
without—within, the villainous green goggling glasses deceitfully
tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely pecked
into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to this mark, and
your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more; and so on to the full
glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.
Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about
a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander.j I
sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a
room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed unoccupied.
“But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no objections to
sharing a harpooner’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’
a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.” I told him
that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do so,
it would depend upon who the harpooner might be, and that if he (the
landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooner was not
decidedly objectionable, why, rather than wander further about a strange
town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent
man’s blanket. “I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want
supper? Supper’ll be ready directly.” I sat down on an old wooden
settle, carved all over like a bench on the Battery.‡ At one end a
ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-knife,
stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs.
He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn’t make
much headway, I thought. At last some four or five of us were summoned
to our meal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at
all—the landlord said he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal
tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our
monkey-jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half
frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind—not only
meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper!
One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these
dumplings in a most direful manner. “My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll
have the nightmare to a dead sartainty.” “Landlord,” I whispered, “that
ain’t the harpooner, is it?” “Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of
diabolically funny, “the harpooner is a dark complexioned chap. He never
eats dumplings, he don’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and likes ’em
rare.” “The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooner? Is he
here?” “He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer. I could not help it,
but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark complexioned” harpooneer.
At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should
sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I did. Supper
over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else
to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a
looker-on. Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the
landlord cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the
offing this morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah,
boys; now we’ll have the latest news from the Feejees.” A tramping of
sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in rolled
a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats,
and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and
ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of
bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, and this was
the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight
wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled little old Jonah,
there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round. One
complained of a bad cold in his head upon which Jonah mixed him a
pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign
cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long
standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather
side of an ice-island. The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it
generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and
they began capering about most obstreperously. I observed, however, that
one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to
spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the
whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man
interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he
should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so
far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little
description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble
shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn
in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth
dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated
some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice at
once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I
thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian
Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its
height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till
he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was
missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge
favourite with them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington!k Bulkington!
where’s Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him. It
was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally
quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little
plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the
seamen. No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good
deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but
people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to
sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,
and that stranger a harpooner, then your objections indefinitely
multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep
two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all
sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and
cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin. The
more I pondered over this harpooner, the more I abominated the thought
of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooner, his
linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest,
certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it
was getting late, and my decent harpooner ought to be home and going
bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how could
I tell from what vile hole he had been coming? “Landlord! I’ve changed
my mind about that harpooner.—I shan’t sleep with him. I’ll try the
bench here.” “Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a
tablecloth for a mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling
of the knots and notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a
carpenter’s plane there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug
enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk
handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at
my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and
left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible
knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for
heaven’s sake to quit—the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not
know how all the planing in the wo</td>

<td align="left">IT IS A TRUTH universally acknowledged, that a single
man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However
little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first
entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of
the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his
lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at
last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she;
“for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer. “Do not you want to know who has taken it?”
cried his wife impatiently. “You want to tell me, and I have no
objection to hearing it.” This was invitation enough. “Why, my dear, you
must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of
large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in
a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it
that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.” “Is he
married or single?” “Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of
large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our
girls!” “How so? how can it affect them?” “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied
his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking
of his marrying one of them.” “Is that his design in settling here?”
“Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may
go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still
better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might
like you the best of the party.” “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly
have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing
extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought
to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “In such cases, a woman has
not often much beauty to think of.” “But, my dear, you must indeed go
and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “It is more
than I engage for, I assure you.” “But consider your daughters. Only
think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and
Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general
you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be
impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.” “You are over scrupulous
surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will
send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his
marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a
good word for my little Lizzy.” “I desire you will do no such thing.
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half
so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are
always giving her the preference.” “They have none of them much to
recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other
girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”
“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take
delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.” “You
mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my
old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
twenty years at least.” “Ah! you do not know what I suffer.” “But I hope
you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a
year come into the neighbourhood.” “It will be no use to us, if twenty
such should come since you will not visit them.” “Depend upon it, my
dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.” Mr. Bennet was
so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice,
that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to
make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to
develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and
uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace
was visiting and news. MR. BENNET WAS AMONG the earliest of those who
waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to
the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the
evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was
then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter
employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, “I hope
Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.” “We are not in a way to know what
Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are not to
visit.” “But you forget, mama,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him
at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.” “I
do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
her.” “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you
do not depend on her serving you.” Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any
reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her
daughters. “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a
little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.” “Kitty has no
discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.” “I do
not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is your
next ball to be, Lizzy?” “To-morrow fortnight.” “Aye, so it is,” cried
her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so,
it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know
him herself.” “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend,
and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.” “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible,
when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?” “I
honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very
little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long
and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think
it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on
myself.” The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,
“Nonsense, nonsense!” “What can be the meaning of that emphatic
exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and
the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with
you there. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep
reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.” Mary wished
to say something very sensible, but knew not how. “While Mary is
adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.” “I
am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife. “I am sorry to hear that; but
why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning,
I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I
have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of
Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of
joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all
the while. “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I
should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.” “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you
chuse,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued
with the raptures of his wife. “What an excellent father you have,
girls,” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will
ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At
our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new
acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.
Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will
dance with you at the next ball.” “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not
afraid; for though I am the youngest, I’m the tallest.” The rest of the
evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s
visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. NOT ALL THAT
Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could
ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any
satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various
ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant
surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last
obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady
Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted
with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable,
and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large
party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a
certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of
Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained. “If I can but see one of my
daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her
husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing
to wish for.” In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and
sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes
of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. An invitation
to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet
planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an
answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in
town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of
their invitation, &amp;c. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could
not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his
arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always
flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield
as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the
idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball;
and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies
and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over
such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by
hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from
London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the
assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether, Mr. Bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend. Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all
the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced
every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of
giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters. Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged,
by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during
part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to
overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the
dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. “Come, Darcy,”
said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by
yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.” “I certainly
shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted
with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room,
whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.” “I would not
be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a kingdom! Upon my
honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have
this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.”
“You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said
Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. “Oh! she is the most
beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters
sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very
agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” “Which do you
mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till
catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, “She is
tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at
present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other
men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you
are wasting your time with me.” Mr. Bingley followed his advice.
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial
feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among
her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted
in any thing ridiculous. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to
the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired
by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she
had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by
this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt
Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the
most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had
been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that
they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in
good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which
they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up.
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he
had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had
raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his
wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found
that he had a very different story to hear. “Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as
she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most
excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing
could be like it. Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley
thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of
that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only
creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked
Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however,
he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he
seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he
enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two
next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth
with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth
with Lizzy, and the Boulanger.” “If he had had any compassion for me,”
cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much!
For God’s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained
his ancle in the first dance!” “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I
am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his
sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw any thing more
elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy. “But I can assure
you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his
fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth
pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He
walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not
handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to
have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.” WHEN JANE
AND ELIZABETH were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her
praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she
admired him. “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she,
“sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so
much ease, with such perfect good breeding!” “He is also handsome,”
replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be, if he
possibly can. His character is thereby complete.” “I was very much
flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such
a compliment.” “Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great
difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me
never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could
not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other
woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he
certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have
liked many a stupider person.” “Dear Lizzy!” “Oh! you are a great deal
too apt you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in
any body. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never
heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.” “I would wish not to
be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.” “I know
you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to
be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation
of candour is common enough;—one meets it every where. But to be candid
without ostentation or design—to take the good of every body’s character
and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you
alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters too, do you? Their manners
are not equal to his.” “Certainly not; at first. But they are very
pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with
her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not
find a very charming neighbour in her.” Elizabeth listened in silence,
but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been
calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation
and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too
unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to
approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good
humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where
they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had
been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a
fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more
than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were
therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and
meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of
England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than
that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.—Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase. His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his
own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley
was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst,
who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to
consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not
been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental
recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into
it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship,
in spite of a great opposition of character.—Bingley was endeared to
Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no
disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with
his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s
regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest
opinion. In understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no
means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offence. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly
was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter
people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and
attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon
felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be
so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a
sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss
Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt
authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. WITHIN A
SHORT WALK of longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were
particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in
Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour
of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty. The
distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him
courteous. Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to
be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.—They had several children. The
eldest of them a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth’s intimate friend. That the Miss Lucases and the Miss
Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and
the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear
and to communicate. “You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said
Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “You were
Mr. Bingley’s first choice.” “Yes;—but he seemed to like his second
better.” “Oh!—you mean Jane, I suppose—because he danced with her twice.
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he
did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about
Mr. Robinson.” “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and
Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how
he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were
a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the
prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question—Oh! the
eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that
point.” “Upon my word!—Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem
as if—but however, it may all come to nothing you know.” “My
overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.” “I beg you would not put
it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a
disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.
Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour
without once opening his lips.” “Are you quite sure, Ma’am?—is not there
a little mistake?” said Jane.—“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to
her.” “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and
he could not help answering her;—but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to.” “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never
speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is
remarkably agreeable.” “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he
had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can
guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I
dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,
and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.” “I do not mind his not
talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I wish he had danced with
Eliza.” “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with
him, if I were you.” “I believe, Ma’am, I may safely promise you never
to dance with him.” “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so
much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot
wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing
in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it,
he has a right to be proud.” “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth,
“and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” “If I were
as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, “I
should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and
drink a bottle of wine every day.” “Then you would drink a great deal
more than you ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it
I should take away your bottle directly.” The boy protested that she
should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument
ended only with the visit. THE LADIES OF Longbourn soon waited on those
of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s
pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley;
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger
sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with
them, was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was
received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw
superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even
her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such
as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence
of their brother’s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they
met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane
was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him
from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she
considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the
world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a
composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would
guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to
her friend Miss Lucas. “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte,
“to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes
a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection
with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity
of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the
world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in
almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We
can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there
are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” “But she
does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive
her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it
too.” “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you
do.” “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to
conceal it, he must find it out.” “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of
her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for
many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed
parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in
conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half
hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him,
there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.” “Your
plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question
but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a
rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these
are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot
even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character</td>

|Amerika  | 1| 8| |id180 |  Der Heizer  Als der sechzehnjährige Karl
Roßmann, der von seinen armen Eltern nach Amerika geschickt worden war,
weil ihn ein Dienstmädchen verführt und ein Kind von ihm bekommen hatte,
in dem schon langsam gewordenen Schiff in den Hafen von New York
einfuhr, erblickte er die schon längst beobachtete Statue der
Freiheitsgöttin wie in einem plötzlich stärker gewordenen Sonnenlicht.
Ihr Arm mit dem Schwert ragte wie neuerdings empor, und um ihre Gestalt
wehten die freien Lüfte. &gt;So hoch!&lt; sagte er sich und wurde, wie
er so gar nicht an das Weggehen dachte, von der immer mehr
anschwellenden Menge der Gepäckträger, die an ihm vorüberzogen,
allmählich bis an das Bordgeländer geschoben. Ein junger Mann, mit dem
er während der Fahrt flüchtig bekannt geworden war, sagte im
Vorübergehen: »Ja, haben Sie denn noch keine Lust, auszusteigen?« »Ich
bin doch fertig«, sagte Karl, ihn anlachend, und hob aus Übermut, und
weil er ein starker Junge war, seinen Koffer auf die Achsel. Aber wie er
über seinen Bekannten hinsah, der ein wenig seinen Stock schwenkend sich
schon mit den andern entfernte, merkte er bestürzt, daß er seinen
eigenen Regenschirm unten im Schiff vergessen hatte. Er bat schnell den
Bekannten, der nicht sehr beglückt schien, um die Freundlichkeit, bei
seinem Koffer einen Augenblick zu warten, überblickte noch die
Situation, um sich bei der Rückkehr zurechtzufinden, und eilte davon.
Unten fand er zu seinem Bedauern einen Gang, der seinen Weg sehr
verkürzt hätte, zum erstenmal versperrt, was wahrscheinlich mit der
Ausschiffung sämtlicher Passagiere zusammenhing, und mußte Treppen, die
einander immer wieder folgten, durch fortwährend abbiegende Korridore,
durch ein leeres Zimmer mit einem verlassenen Schreibtisch mühselig
suchen, bis er sich tatsächlich, da er diesen Weg nur ein- oder zweimal
und immer in größerer Gesellschaft gegangen war, ganz und gar verirrt
hatte. In seiner Ratlosigkeit und da er keinen Menschen traf und nur
immerfort über sich das Scharren der tausend Menschenfüße hörte und von
der Ferne, wie einen Hauch, das letzte Arbeiten der schon eingestellten
Maschinen merkte, fing er, ohne zu überlegen, an eine beliebige kleine
Tür zu schlagen an, bei der er in seinem Herumirren stockte. »Es ist ja
offen«, rief es von innen, und Karl öffnete mit ehrlichem Aufatmen die
Tür. »Warum schlagen Sie so verrückt auf die Tür?« fragte ein riesiger
Mann, kaum daß er nach Karl hinsah. Durch irgendeine Oberlichtluke fiel
ein trübes, oben im Schiff längst abgebrauchtes Licht in die klägliche
Kabine, in welcher ein Bett, ein Schrank, ein Sessel und der Mann knapp
nebeneinander, wie eingelagert, standen. »Ich habe mich verirrt«, sagte
Karl, »Ich habe es während der Fahrt gar nicht so bemerkt, aber es ist
ein schrecklich großes Schiff.« »Ja, da haben Sie recht«, sagte der Mann
mit einigem Stolz und hörte nicht auf, an dem Schloß eines kleinen
Koffers zu hantieren, den er mit beiden Händen immer wieder zudrückte,
um das Einschnappen des Riegels zu behorchen. »Aber kommen Sie doch
herein!« sagte der Mann weiter, »Sie werden doch nicht draußen stehn!«
»Störe ich nicht?« fragte Karl. »Ach, wie werden Sie denn stören!« »Sind
Sie ein Deutscher?« suchte sich Karl noch zu versichern, da er viel von
den Gefahren gehört hatte, welche besonders von Irländern den
Neuankömmlingen in Amerika drohen. »Bin ich, bin ich«, sagte der Mann.
Karl zögerte noch. Da faßte unversehens der Mann die Türklinke und schob
mit der Türe, die er rasch schloß, Karl zu sich herein. »Ich kann es
nicht leiden, wenn man mir vom Gang hereinschaut«, sagte der Mann, der
wieder an seinem Koffer arbeitete, »da läuft jeder vorbei und schaut
herein, das soll der Zehnte aushalten!« »Aber der Gang ist doch ganz
leer«, sagte Karl, der unbehaglich an den Bettpfosten gequetscht
dastand. »Ja, jetzt«, sagte der Mann.&gt;Es handelt sich doch um
jetzt&lt;, dachte Karl, &gt;mit dem Mann ist schwer zu reden.&lt; »Legen
Sie sich doch aufs Bett, da haben Sie mehr Platz«, sagte der Mann. Karl
kroch, so gut es ging, hinein und lachte dabei laut über den ersten
vergeblichen Versuch, sich hinüberzuschwingen. Kaum war er aber im Bett,
rief er: »Gotteswillen, ich habe ja ganz meinen Koffer vergessen!« »Wo
ist er denn?« »Oben auf dem Deck, ein Bekannter gibt acht auf ihn. Wie
heißt er nur?« Und er zog aus seiner Geheimtasche, die ihm seine Mutter
für die Reise im Rockfutter angelegt hatte, eine Visitkarte.
»Butterbaum, Franz Butterbaum.« »Haben Sie den Koffer sehr nötig?«
»Natürlich.« »Ja, warum haben Sie ihn dann einem fremden Menschen
gegeben?« »Ich habe meinen Regenschirm unten vergessen und bin gelaufen,
um ihn zu holen, wollte aber den Koffer nicht mitschleppen. Dann habe
ich mich auch hier noch verirrt.« »Sie sind allein? Ohne Begleitung?«
»Ja, allein.« &gt;Ich sollte mich vielleicht an diesen Mann halten&lt;,
ging es Karl durch den Kopf, &gt;wo finde ich gleich einen besseren
Freund.&lt; »Und jetzt haben Sie auch noch den Koffer verloren. Vom
Regenschirm rede ich gar nicht.« Und der Mann setzte sich auf den
Sessel, als habe Karls Sache jetzt einiges Interesse für ihn gewonnen.
»Ich glaube aber, der Koffer ist noch nicht verloren.« »Glauben macht
selig«, sagte der Mann und kratzte sich kräftig in seinem dunklen,
kurzen, dichten Haar, »auf dem Schiff wechseln mit den Hafenplätzen auch
die Sitten. In Hamburg hätte Ihr Butterbaum den Koffer vielleicht
bewacht, hier ist höchstwahrscheinlich von beiden keine Spur mehr.« »Da
muß ich aber doch gleich hinaufschauen«, sagte Karl und sah sich um, wie
er hinauskommen könnte. »Bleiben Sie nur«, sagte der Mann und stieß ihn
mit einer Hand gegen die Brust, geradezu rauh, ins Bett zurück. »Warum
denn?« fragte Karl ärgerlich. »Weil es keinen Sinn hat«, sagte der Mann,
»in einem kleinen Weilchen gehe ich auch, dann gehen wir zusammen.
Entweder ist der Koffer gestohlen, dann ist keine Hilfe, oder der Mann
hat ihn stehengelassen, dann werden wir ihn, bis das Schiff ganz
entleert ist, desto besser finden. Ebenso auch Ihren Regenschirm.«
»Kennen Sie sich auf dem Schiff aus?« fragte Karl mißtrauisch, und es
schien ihm, als hätte der sonst überzeugende Gedanke, daß auf dem leeren
Schiff seine Sachen am besten zu finden sein würden, einen verborgenen
Haken. »Ich bin doch Schiffsheizer«, sagte der Mann. »Sie sind
Schiffsheizer!« rief Karl freudig, als überstiege das alle Erwartungen,
und sah, den Ellbogen aufgestützt, den Mann näher an. »Gerade vor der
Kammer, wo ich mit dem Slowaken geschlafen habe, war eine Luke
angebracht, durch die man in den Maschinenraum sehen konnte.« »Ja, dort
habe ich gearbeitet,« sagte der Heizer. »Ich habe mich immer so für
Technik interessiert«, sagte Karl, der in einem bestimmten Gedankengang
blieb, »und ich wäre sicher später Ingenieur geworden, wenn ich nicht
nach Amerika hätte fahren müssen.« »Warum haben Sie denn fahren müssen?«
»Ach was!« sagte Karl und warf die ganze Geschichte mit der Hand weg.
Dabei sah er lächelnd den Heizer an, als bitte er ihn selbst für das
Nichteingestandene um seine Nachsicht. »Es wird schon einen Grund
haben«, sagte der Heizer, und man wußte nicht recht, ob er damit die
Erzählung dieses Grundes fordern oder abwehren wollte. »Jetzt könnte ich
auch Heizer werden«, sagte Karl, »meinen Eltern ist es jetzt ganz
gleichgültig, was ich werde.« »Meine Stelle wird frei«, sagte der
Heizer, gab im Vollbewußtsein dessen die Hände in die Hosentaschen und
warf die Beine, die in faltigen, lederartigen, eisengrauen Hosen staken,
aufs Bett hin, um sie zu strecken. Karl mußte mehr an die Wand rücken.
»Sie verlassen das Schiff?« »Jawohl, wir marschieren heute ab.« »Warum
denn? Gefällt es Ihnen nicht?« »Ja, das sind die Verhältnisse, es
entscheidet nicht immer, ob es einem gefällt oder nicht. Übrigens haben
Sie recht, es gefällt mir auch nicht. Sie denken wahrscheinlich nicht
ernstlich daran, Heizer zu werden, aber gerade dann kann man es am
leichtesten werden. Ich also rate Ihnen entschieden ab. Wenn Sie in
Europa studieren wollten, warum wollen Sie es denn hier nicht? Die
amerikanischen Universitäten sind ja unvergleichbar besser als die
europäischen.« »Es ist ja möglich«, sagte Karl, »aber ich habe ja fast
kein Geld zum Studieren. Ich habe zwar von irgend jemandem gelesen, der
bei Tag in einem Geschäft gearbeitet und in der Nacht studiert hat, bis
er Doktor und ich glaube Bürgermeister wurde, aber dazu gehört doch eine
große Ausdauer, nicht? Ich fürchte, die fehlt mir. Außerdem war ich kein
besonders guter Schüler, der Abschied von der Schule ist mir wirklich
nicht schwer geworden. Und die Schulen hier sind vielleicht noch
strenger. Englisch kann ich fast gar nicht. Überhaupt ist man hier gegen
Fremde so eingenommen, glaube ich.« »Haben Sie das auch schon erfahren?
Na, dann ist’s gut. Dann sind Sie mein Mann. Sehen Sie, wir sind doch
auf einem deutschen Schiff, es gehört der Hamburg-Amerika-Linie, warum
sind wir nicht lauter Deutsche hier? Warum ist der Obermaschinist ein
Rumäne? Er heißt Schubal. Das ist doch nicht zu glauben. Und dieser
Lumpenhund schindet uns Deutsche auf einem deutschen Schiff! Glauben Sie
nicht« - ihm ging die Luft aus, er fackelte mit der Hand -, »daß ich
klage, um zu klagen. Ich weiß, daß Sie keinen Einfluß haben und selbst
ein armes Bürschchen sind. Aber es ist zu arg!« Und er schlug auf den
Tisch mehrmals mit der Faust und ließ kein Auge von ihr, während er
schlug. »Ich habe doch schon auf so vielen Schiffen gedient« - und er
nannte zwanzig Namen hintereinander, als sei es ein Wort, Karl wurde
ganz wirr - »und habe mich ausgezeichnet, bin belobt worden, war ein
Arbeiter nach dem Geschmack meiner Kapitäne, sogar auf dem gleichen
Handelssegler war ich einige Jahre« - er erhob sich, als sei das der
Höchstpunkt seines Lebens - »und hier auf diesem Kasten, wo alles nach
der Schnur eingerichtet ist, wo kein Witz gefordert wird, hier taug ich
nichts, hier stehe ich dem Schubal immer im Wege, bin ein Faulpelz,
verdiene hinausgeworfen zu werden und bekomme meinen Lohn aus Gnade.
Verstehen Sie das? Ich nicht.« »Das dürfen Sie sich nicht gefallen
lassen«, sagte Karl aufgeregt. Er hatte fast das Gefühl davon verloren,
daß er auf dem unsicheren Boden eines Schiffes, an der Küste eines
unbekannten Erdteils war, so heimisch war ihm hier auf dem Bett des
Heizers zumute. »Waren Sie schon beim Kapitän? Haben Sie schon bei ihm
Ihr Recht gesucht?« »Ach gehen Sie, gehen Sie lieber weg. Ich will Sie
nicht hier haben. Sie hören nicht zu, was ich sage, und geben mir
Ratschläge. Wie soll ich denn zum Kapitän gehen!« Und müde setzte sich
der Heizer wieder und legte das Gesicht in beide Hände. &gt;Einen
besseren Rat kann ich ihm nicht geben&lt;, sagte sich Karl. Und er fand
überhaupt, daß er lieber seinen Koffer hätte holen sollen, statt hier
Ratschläge zu geben, die doch nur für dumm gehalten wurden. Als ihm der
Vater den Koffer für immer übergeben hatte, hatte er im Scherz gefragt:
»Wie lange wirst du ihn haben?« und jetzt war dieser treue Koffer
vielleicht schon im Ernst verloren. Der einzige Trost war noch, daß der
Vater von seiner jetzigen Lage kaum erfahren konnte, selbst wenn er
nachforschen sollte. Nur daß er bis New York mitgekommen war, konnte die
Schiffsgesellschaft gerade noch sagen. Leid tat es aber Karl, daß er die
Sachen im Koffer noch kaum verwendet hatte, trotzdem er es
beispielsweise längst nötig gehabt hätte, das Hemd zu wechseln. Da hatte
er also am unrichtigen Ort gespart; jetzt, wo er es gerade am Beginn
seiner Laufbahn nötig haben würde, rein gekleidet aufzutreten, würde er
im schmutzigen Hemd erscheinen müssen. Sonst wäre der Verlust des
Koffers nicht gar so arg gewesen, denn der Anzug, den er anhatte, war
sogar besser als jener im Koffer, der eigentlich nur ein Notanzug war,
den die Mutter noch knapp vor der Abreise hatte flicken müssen. Jetzt
erinnerte er sich auch, daß im Koffer noch ein Stück Veroneser Salami
war, die ihm die Mutter als Extragabe eingepackt hatte, von der er
jedoch nur den kleinsten Teil hatte aufessen können, da er während der
Fahrt ganz ohne Appetit gewesen war und die Suppe, die im Zwischendeck
zur Verteilung kam, ihm reichlich genügt hatte. Jetzt hätte er aber die
Wurst gern bei der Hand gehabt, um sie dem Heizer zu verehren. Denn
solche Leute sind leicht gewonnen, wenn man ihnen irgendeine Kleinigkeit
zusteckt, das wußte Karl von seinem Vater her, welcher durch
Zigarrenverteilung alle die niedrigen Angestellten gewann, mit denen er
geschäftlich zu tun hatte. Jetzt besaß Karl an Verschenkbarem nur noch
sein Geld, und das wollte er, wenn er schon vielleicht den Koffer
verloren haben sollte, vorläufig nicht anrühren. Wieder kehrten seine
Gedanken zum Koffer zurück, und er konnte jetzt wirklich nicht einsehen,
warum er den Koffer während der Fahrt so aufmerksam bewacht hatte, daß
ihm die Wache fast den Schlaf gekostet hatte, wenn er jetzt diesen
gleichen Koffer so leicht sich hatte wegnehmen lassen. Er erinnerte sich
an die fünf Nächte, während derer er einen kleinen Slowaken, der zwei
Schlafstellen links von ihm gelegen war, unausgesetzt im Verdacht gehabt
hatte, daß er es auf seinen Koffer abgesehen habe. Dieser Slowake hatte
nur darauf gelauert, daß Karl endlich, von Schwäche befallen, für einen
Augenblick einnickte, damit er den Koffer mit einer langen Stange, mit
der er immer während des Tages spielte oder übte, zu sich hinüberziehen
könne. Bei Tage sah dieser Slowake unschuldig genug aus, aber kaum war
die Nacht gekommen, erhob er sich von Zeit zu Zeit von seinem Lager und
sah traurig zu Karls Koffer hinüber. Karl konnte dies ganz deutlich
erkennen, denn immer hatte hie und da jemand mit der Unruhe des
Auswanderers ein Lichtchen angezündet, trotzdem dies nach der
Schiffsordnung verboten war, und versuchte, unverständliche Prospekte
der Auswanderungsagenturen zu entziffern. War ein solches Licht in der
Nähe, dann konnte Karl ein wenig eindämmern, war es aber in der Ferne
oder war dunkel, dann mußte er die Augen offenhalten. Diese Anstrengung
hatte ihn recht erschöpft, und nun war sie vielleicht ganz nutzlos
gewesen. Dieser Butterbaum, wenn er ihn einmal irgendwo treffen sollte!
In diesem Augenblick ertönten draußen in weiter Ferne in die bisherige
vollkommene Ruhe hinein kleine kurze Schläge, wie von Kinderfüßen, sie
kamen näher mit verstärktem Klang, und nun war es ein ruhiger Marsch von
Männern. Sie gingen offenbar, wie es in dem schmalen Gang natürlich war,
in einer Reihe, man hörte Klirren wie von Waffen. Karl, der schon nahe
daran gewesen war, sich im Bett zu einem von allen Sorgen um Koffer und
Slowaken befreiten Schlafe auszustrecken, schreckte auf und stieß den
Heizer an, um ihn endlich aufmerksam zu machen, denn der Zug schien mit
seiner Spitze die Tür gerade erreicht zu haben. »Das ist die
Schiffskapelle,« sagte der Heizer, »die haben oben gespielt und gehen
jetzt einpacken. Jetzt ist alles fertig und wir können gehen. Kommen
Sie!« Er faßte Karl bei der Hand, nahm noch im letzten Augenblick ein
eingerahmtes Muttergottesbild von der Wand über dem Bett, stopfte es in
seine Brusttasche, ergriff seinen Koffer und verließ mit Karl eilig die
Kabine. »Jetzt gehe ich ins Büro und werde den Herren meine Meinung
sagen. Es ist kein Passagier mehr da, man muß keine Rücksicht nehmen.«
Dieses wiederholte der Heizer verschiedenartig und wollte im Gehen mit
Seitwärtsstoßen des Fußes eine den Weg kreuzende Ratte niedertreten,
stieß sie aber bloß schneller in das Loch hinein, das sie noch
rechtzeitig erreicht hatte. Er war überhaupt langsam in seinen
Bewegungen, denn wenn er auch lange Beine hatte, so waren sie doch zu
schwer. Sie kamen durch eine Abteilung der Küche, wo einige Mädchen in
schmutzigen Schürzen - sie begossen sie absichtlich - Geschirr in großen
Bottichen reinigten. Der Heizer rief eine gewisse Line zu sich, legte
den Arm um ihre Hüfte und führte sie, die sich immerzu kokett gegen
seinen Arm drückte, ein Stückchen mit. »Es gibt jetzt Auszahlung, willst
du mitkommen?« fragte er. »Warum soll ich mich bemühn, bring mir das
Geld lieber her«, antwortete sie, schlüpfte unter seinem Arm durch und
lief davon. »Wo hast du denn den schönen Knaben aufgegabelt?« rief sie
noch, wollte aber keine Antwort mehr. Man hörte das Lachen aller
Mädchen, die ihre Arbeit unterbrochen hatten. Sie aber gingen weiter und
kamen an eine Tür, die oben einen kleinen Vorgiebel hatte, der von
kleinen, vergoldeten Karyatiden getragen war. Für eine
Schiffseinrichtung sah das recht verschwenderisch aus. Karl war, wie er
merkte, niemals in diese Gegend gekommen, die wahrscheinlich während der
Fahrt den Passagieren der ersten und zweiten Klasse vorbehalten gewesen
war, während man jetzt vor der großen Schiffsreinigung die
Trennungstüren ausgehoben hatte. Sie waren auch tatsächlich schon
einigen Männern begegnet, die Besen an der Schulter trugen und den
Heizer gegrüßt hatten. Karl staunte über den großen Betrieb, in seinem
Zwischendeck hatte er davon freilich wenig erfahren. Längs der Gänge
zogen sich auch Drähte elektrischer Leitungen, und eine kleine Glocke
hörte man immerfort. Der Heizer klopfte respektvoll an der Türe an und
forderte, als man »Herein!« rief, Karl mit einer Handbewegung auf, ohne
Furcht einzutreten. Dieser trat auch ein, aber blieb an der Tür stehen.
Vor den drei Fenstern des Zimmers sah er die Wellen des Meeres, und bei
Betrachtung ihrer fröhlichen Bewegung schlug ihm das Herz, als hätte er
nicht fünf lange Tage das Meer ununterbrochen gesehen. Große Schiffe
kreuzten gegenseitig ihre Wege und gaben dem Wellengang nur so weit
nach, als es ihre Schwere erlaubte. Wenn man die Augen klein machte,
schienen diese Schiffe vor lauter Schwere zu schwanken. Auf ihren Masten
trugen sie schmale, aber lange Flaggen, die zwar durch die Fahrt
gestrafft wurden, trotzdem aber noch hin und her zappelten.
Wahrscheinlich von Kriegsschiffen her erklangen Salutschüsse, die
Kanonenrohre eines solchen nicht allzuweit vorüberfahrenden Schiffes,
strahlend mit dem Reflex ihres Stahlmantels, waren wie gehätschelt von
der sicheren, glatten und doch nicht waagrechten Fahrt. Die kleinen
Schiffchen und Boote konnte man, wenigstens von der Tür aus, nur in der
Ferne beobachten, wie sie in Mengen in die Öffnungen zwischen den großen
Schiffen einliefen. Hinter alledem aber stand New York und sah Karl mit
hunderttausend Fenstern seiner Wolkenkratzer an. Ja, in diesem Zimmer
wußte man, wo man war. An einem runden Tisch saßen drei Herren, der eine
ein Schiffsoffizier in blauer Schiffsuniform, die zwei anderen, Beamte
der Hafenbehörde, in schwarzen amerikanischen Uniformen. Auf dem Tisch
lagen, hochaufgeschichtet, verschiedene Dokumente, welche der Offizier
zuerst mit der Feder in der Hand überflog, um sie dann den beiden
anderen zu reichen, die bald lasen, bald exzerpierten, bald in ihre
Aktentaschen einlegten, wenn nicht gerade der eine, der fast
ununterbrochen ein kleines Geräusch mit den Zähnen vollführte, seinem
Kollegen etwas in ein Protokoll diktierte. Am Fenster saß an einem
Schreibtisch, den Rücken der Tür zugewendet, ein kleinerer Herr, der mit
großen Folianten hantierte, die auf einem starken Bücherbrett in
Kopfhöhe vor ihm aneinandergereiht waren. Neben ihm stand eine offene,
wenigstens auf den ersten Blick leere Kassa. Das zweite Fenster war leer
und gab den besten Ausblick. In der Nähe des dritten aber standen zwei
Herren in halblautem Gespräch. Der eine lehnte neben dem Fenster, trug
auch die Schiffsuniform und spielte mit dem Griff des Degens. Derjenige,
mit dem er sprach, war dem Fenster zugewendet und enthüllte hie und da
durch eine Bewegung einen Teil der Ordensreihe auf der Brust des andern.
Er war in Zivil und hatte ein dünnes Bambusstöckchen, das, da er beide
Hände an den Hüften festhielt, auch wie ein Degen abstand. Karl hatte
nicht viel Zeit, alles anzusehen, denn bald trat ein Diener auf sie zu
und fragte den Heizer mit einem Blick, als gehöre er nicht hierher, was
er denn wolle. Der Heizer antwortete, so leise als er gefragt wurde, er
wolle mit dem Herrn Oberkassier reden. Der Diener lehnte für seinen Teil
mit einer Handbewegung diese Bitte ab, ging aber dennoch auf den
Fußspitzen, dem runden Tisch in großem Bogen ausweichend, zu dem Herrn
mit den Folianten. Dieser Herr - das sah man deutlich - erstarrte
geradezu unter den Worten des Dieners, kehrte sich aber endlich nach dem
Manne um, der ihn zu sprechen wünschte, und fuchtelte dann, streng
abwehrend, gegen den Heizer und der Sicherheit halber auch gegen den
Diener hin. Der Diener kehrte darauf zum Heizer zurück und sagte in
einem Tone, als vertraue er ihm etwas an: »Scheren Sie sich sofort aus
dem Zimmer!« Der Heizer sah nach dieser Antwort zu Karl hinunter, als
sei dieser sein Herz, dem er stumm seinen Jammer klage. Ohne weitere
Besinnung machte sich Karl los, lief quer durchs Zimmer, daß er sogar
leicht an den Sessel des Offiziers streifte, der Diener lief gebeugt mit
zum Umfangen bereiten Armen, als jage er ein Ungeziefer, aber Karl war
der erste beim Tisch des Oberkassiers, wo er sich festhielt, für den
Fall, daß der Diener versuchen sollte, ihn fortzuziehen. Natürlich wurde
gleich das Zimmer lebendig. Der Schiffsoffizier am Tisch war
aufgesprungen, die Herren von der Hafenbehörde sahen ruhig, aber
aufmerksam zu, die beiden Herren am Fenster waren nebeneinandergetreten,
der Diener, welcher glaubte, er sei dort, wo schon die hohen Herren
Interesse zeigten, nicht mehr am Platze, trat zurück. Der Heizer an der
Türe wartete angespannt auf den Augenblick, bis seine Hilfe nötig würde.
Der Oberkassier endlich machte in seinem Lehnsessel eine große
Rechtswendung. Karl kramte aus seiner Geheimtasche, die er den Blicken
dieser Leute zu zeigen keine Bedenken hatte, seinen Reisepaß hervor, den
er statt weiterer Vorstellung geöffnet auf den Tisch legte. Der
Oberkassier schien diesen Paß für nebensächlich zu halten, denn er
schnappte ihn mit zwei Fingern beiseite, worauf Karl, als sei diese
Formalität zur Zufriedenheit erledigt, den Paß wieder einsteckte. »Ich
erlaube mir zu sagen«, begann er dann, »daß meiner Meinung nach dem
Herrn Heizer Unrecht geschehen ist. Es ist hier ein gewisser Schubal,
der ihm aufsitzt. Er selbst hat schon auf vielen Schiffen, die er Ihnen
alle nennen kann, zur vollständigen Zufriedenheit gedient, ist fleißig,
meint es mit seiner Arbeit gut, und es ist wirklich nicht einzusehen,
warum er gerade auf diesem Schiff, wo doch der Dienst nicht so übermäßig
schwer ist, wie zum Beispiel auf Handelsseglern, schlecht entsprechen
sollte. Es kann daher nur Verleumdung sein, die ihn in seinem
Vorwärtskommen hindert und ihn um die Anerkennung bringt, die ihm sonst
ganz bestimmt nicht fehlen würde. Ich habe nur das Allgemeine über diese
Sache gesagt, seine besonderen Beschwerden wird er Ihnen selbst
vorbringen.« Karl hatte sich mit dieser Rede an alle Herren gewendet,
weil ja tatsächlich auch alle zuhörten und es viel wahrscheinlicher
schien, daß sich unter allen zusammen ein Gerechter vorfand, als daß
dieser Gerechte gerade der Oberkassier sein sollte. Aus Schlauheit hatte
außerdem Karl verschwiegen, daß er den Heizer erst so kurze Zeit kannte.
Im übrigen hätte er noch viel besser gesprochen, wenn er nicht durch das
rote Gesicht des Herrn mit dem Bambusstöckchen beirrt worden wäre, das
er von seinem jetzigen Standort zum erstenmal sah. »Es ist alles Wort
für Wort richtig«, sagte der Heizer, ehe ihn noch jemand gefragt, ja ehe
man noch überhaupt auf ihn hingesehen hatte. Diese Übereiltheit des
Heizers wäre ein großer Fehler gewesen, wenn nicht der Herr mit den
Orden, der, wie es jetzt Karl aufleuchtete, jedenfalls der Kapitän war,
offenbar mit sich bereits übereingekommen wäre, den Heizer anzuhören. Er
streckte nämlich die Hand aus und rief dem Heizer zu: »Kommen Sie her!«
mit einer Stimme, fest, um mit einem Hammer darauf zu schlagen. Jetzt
hing alles vom Benehmen des Heizers ab, denn was die Gerechtigkeit
seiner Sache anlangte, an der zweifelte Karl nicht. Glücklicherweise
zeigte sich bei dieser Gelegenheit, daß der Heizer schon viel in der
Welt herumgekommen war. Musterhaft ruhig nahm er aus seinem Köfferchen
mit dem ersten Griff ein Bündelchen Papiere sowie ein Notizbuch, ging
damit, als verstünde sich das von selbst, unter vollständiger
Vernachlässigung des Oberkassiers, zum Kapitän und breitete auf dem
Fensterbrett seine Beweismittel aus. Dem Oberkassier blieb nichts übrig,
als sich selbst hinzubemühn. »Der Mann ist ein bekannter Querulant«,
sagte er zur Erklärung, »er ist mehr in der Kassa als im Maschinenraum.
Er hat Schubal, diesen ruhigen Menschen, ganz zur Verzweiflung gebracht.
Hören Sie einmal!« wandte er sich an den Heizer, »Sie treiben Ihre
Zudringlichkeit doch schon wirklich zu weit. Wie oft hat man Sie schon
aus den Auszahlungsräumen hinausgeworfen, wie Sie es mit Ihren ganz,
vollständig und ausnahmslos unberechtigten Forderungen verdienen! Wie
oft sind Sie von dort in die Hauptkassa gelaufen gekommen! Wie oft hat
man Ihnen im guten gesagt, daß Schubal Ihr unmittelbarer Vorgesetzter
ist, mit dem allein Sie sich als ein Untergebener abzufinden haben! Und
jetzt kommen Sie gar noch her, wenn der Herr Kapitän da ist, schämen
sich nicht, sogar ihn zu belästigen, sondern entblöden sich nicht
einmal, als eingelernten Stimmführer Ihrer abgeschmackten
Beschuldigungen diesen Kleinen mitzubringen, den ich überhaupt zum
erstenmal auf dem Schiffe sehe!« Karl hielt sich mit Gewalt zurück,
vorzuspringen. Aber schon war auch der Kapitän da, welcher sagte: »Hören
wir den Mann doch einmal an. Der Schubal wird mir sowieso mit der Zeit
viel zu selbständig, womit ich aber nichts zu Ihren Gunsten gesagt haben
will.« Das letztere galt dem Heizer, es war nur natürlich, daß er sich
nicht sofort für ihn einsetzen konnte, aber alles schien auf dem
richtigen Wege. Der Heizer begann seine Erklärungen und überwand sich
gleich am Anfang, indem er Schubal mit »Herr« titulierte. Wie freute
sich Karl am verlassenen Schreibtisch des Oberkassiers, wo er eine
Briefwaage immer wieder niederdrückte vor lauter Vergnügen. - Herr
Schubal ist ungerecht! Herr Schubal bevorzugt die Ausländer! Herr
Schubal verwies den Heizer aus dem Maschinenraum und ließ ihn Klosette
reinigen, was doch gewiß nicht des Heizers Sache war! - Einmal wurde
sogar die Tüchtigkeit des Herrn Schubal angezweifelt, die eher scheinbar
als wirklich vorhanden sein sollte. Bei dieser Stelle starrte Karl mit
aller Kraft den Kapitän an, zutunlich, als sei er sein Kollege, nur
damit er sich durch die etwas ungeschickte Ausdrucksweise des Heizers
nicht zu dessen Ungunsten beeinflussen lasse. Immerhin erfuhr man aus
den vielen Reden nichts Eigentliches, und wenn auch der Kapitän noch
immer vor sich hinsah, in den Augen die Entschlossenheit, den Heizer
diesmal bis zu Ende anzuhören, so wurden doch die anderen Herren
ungeduldig, und die Stimme des Heizers regierte bald nicht mehr
unumschränkt in dem Raume, was manches befürchten ließ. Als erster
setzte der Herr in Zivil sein Bambusstöckchen in Tätigkeit und klopfte,
wenn auch nur leise, auf das Parkett. Die anderen Herren sahen natürlich
hie und da hin, die Herren von der Hafenbehörde, die offenbar pressiert
waren, griffen wieder zu den Akten und begannen, wenn auch noch etwas
geistesabwesend, sie durchzusehen, der Schiffsoffizier rückte seinen
Tisch wieder näher, und der Oberkassier, der gewonnenes Spiel zu haben
glaubte, seufzte aus Ironie tief auf. Von der allgemein eintretenden
Zerstreuung schien nur der Diener bewahrt, der von den Leiden des unter
die Großen gestellten armen Mannes einen Teil mitfühlte und Karl ernst
zunickte, als wolle er damit etwas erklären. Inzwischen ging vor den
Fenstern das Hafenleben weiter, ein flaches Lastschiff mit einem Berg
von Fässern, die wunderbar verstaut sein mußten, daß sie nicht ins
Rollen kamen, zog vorüber und erzeugte in dem Zimmer fast Dunkelheit;
kleine Motorboote, die Karl jetzt, wenn er Zeit gehabt hätte, genau
hätte ansehen können, rauschten nach den Zuckungen der Hände eines am
Steuer aufrecht stehenden Mannes schnurgerade dahin! Eigentümliche
Schwimmkörper tauchten hie und da selbständig aus dem ruhelosen Wasser,
wurden gleich wieder überschwemmt und versanken vor dem erstaunten
Blick; Boote der Ozeandampfer wurden von heiß arbeitenden Matrosen
vorwärtsgerudert und waren voll von Passagieren, die darin, so wie man
sie hineingezwängt hatte, still und erwartungsvoll saßen, wenn es auch
manche nicht unterlassen konnten, die Köpfe nach den wechselnden
Szenerien zu drehen. Eine Bewegung ohne Ende, eine Unruhe, übertragen
von dem unruhigen Element auf die hilflosen Menschen und ihre Werke!
Aber alles mahnte zur Eile, zur Deutlichkeit, zu ganz genauer
Darstellung; aber was tat der Heizer? Er redete sich allerdings in
Schweiß, die Papiere auf dem Fenster konnte er längst mit seinen
zitternden Händen nicht mehr halten; aus allen Himmelsrichtungen
strömten ihm Klagen über Schubal zu, von denen seiner Meinung nach jede
einzelne genügt hätte, diesen Schubal vollständig zu begraben, aber was
er dem Kapitän vorzeigen konnte, war nur ein trauriges
Durcheinanderstrudeln aller insgesamt. Längst schon pfiff der Herr mit
dem Bambusstöckchen schwach zur Decke hinauf, die Herren von der
Hafenbehörde hielten schon den Offizier an ihrem Tisch und machten keine
Miene, ihn je wieder loszulassen, der Oberkassier wurde sichtlich nur
durch die Ruhe des Kapitäns vor dem Dreinfahren zurückgehalten, der
Diener erwartete in Habachtstellung jeden Augenblick einen auf den
Heizer bezüglichen Befehl seines Kapitäns. Da konnte Karl nicht mehr
untätig bleiben. Er ging also langsam zu der Gruppe hin und überlegte im
Gehen nur desto schneller, wie er die Sache möglichst geschickt
angreifen könnte. Es war wirklich höchste Zeit, noch ein kleines
Weilchen nur, und sie konnten ganz gut beide aus dem Büro fliegen. Der
Kapitän mochte ja ein guter Mann sein und überdies gerade jetzt, wie es
Karl schien, irgendeinen besonderen Grund haben, sich als gerechter
Vorgesetzter zu zeigen, aber schließlich war er kein Instrument, das man
in Grund und Boden spielen konnte - und gerade so behandelte ihn der
Heizer, allerdings aus seinem grenzenlos empörten Innern heraus. Karl
sagte also zum Heizer: »Sie müssen das einfacher erzählen, klarer, der
Herr Kapitän kann es nicht würdigen, so wie Sie es ihm erzählen. Kennt
er denn alle Maschinisten und Laufburschen beim Namen oder gar beim
Taufnamen, daß er, wenn Sie nur einen solchen Namen aussprechen, gleich
wissen kann, um wen es sich handelt? Ordnen Sie doch Ihre Beschwerden,
sagen Sie die wichtigste zuerst und absteigend die anderen, vielleicht
wird es dann überhaupt nicht mehr nötig sein, die meisten auch nur zu
erwähnen. Mir haben Sie es doch immer so klar dargestellt!« &gt;Wenn man
in Amerika Koffer stehlen kann, kann man auch hie und da lügen&lt;,
dachte er zur Entschuldigung. Wenn es aber nur geholfen hätte! Ob es
nicht auch schon zu spät war? Der Heizer unterbrach sich zwar sofort,
als er die bekannte Stimme hörte, aber mit seinen Augen, die ganz von
Tränen der beleidigten Mannesehre, der schrecklichen Erinnerungen, der
äußersten gegenwärtigen Not verdeckt waren, konnte er Karl schon nicht
einmal mehr gut erkennen. Wie sollte er auch jetzt - Karl sah das
schweigend vor dem jetzt Schweigenden wohl ein -, wie sollte er auch
jetzt plötzlich seine Redeweise ändern, da es ihm doch schien, als hätte
er alles, was zu sagen war, ohne die geringste Anerkennung schon
vorgebracht und als habe er andererseits noch gar nichts gesagt und
könne doch den Herren jetzt nicht zumuten, noch alles anzuhören. Und in
einem solchen Zeitpunkt kommt noch Karl, sein einziger Anhänger, daher,
will ihm gute Lehren geben, zeigt ihm aber statt dessen, daß alles,
alles verloren ist. &gt;Wäre ich früher gekommen, statt aus dem Fenster
zu schauen!&lt; sagte sich Karl, senkte vor dem Heizer das Gesicht und
schlug die Hände an die Hosennaht, zum Zeichen des Endes jeder Hoffnung.
Aber der Heizer mißverstand das, witterte wohl in Karl irgendwelche
geheimen Vorwürfe gegen sich, und in der guten Absicht, sie ihm
auszureden, fing er zur Krönung seiner Taten mit Karl jetzt zu streiten
an. Jetzt, wo doch die Herren am runden Tisch längst empört über den
nutzlosen Lärm waren, der ihre wichtigen Arbeiten störte, wo der
Hauptkassier allmählich die Geduld des Kapitäns unverständlich fand und
zum sofortigen Ausbruch neigte, wo der Diener, ganz wieder in der Sphäre
seiner Herren, den Heizer mit wildem Blicke maß, und wo endlich der Herr
mit dem Bambusstöckchen, zu welchem sogar der Kapitän hie und da
freundlich hinübersah, schon gänzlich abgestumpft gegen den Heizer, ja
von ihm angewidert, ein kleines Notizbuch hervorzog und, offenbar mit
ganz anderen Angelegenheiten beschäftigt, die Augen zwischen dem
Notizbuch und Karl hin und her wandern ließ. »Ich weiß ja«, sagte Karl,
der Mühe hatte, den jetzt gegen ihn gekehrten Schwall des Heizers
abzuwehren, trotzdem aber quer durch allen Streit noch ein
Freundeslächeln für ihn übrig hatte, »Sie haben recht, recht, ich habe
ja nie daran gezweifelt.« Er hätte ihm gern aus Furcht vor Schlägen die
herumfahrenden Hände gehalten, noch lieber allerdings ihn in einen
Winkel gedrängt, um ihm ein paar leise, beruhigende Worte zuzuflüstern,
die niemand sonst hätte hören müssen. Aber der Heizer war außer Rand und
Band. Karl begann jetzt schon sogar aus dem Gedanken eine Art Trost zu
schöpfen, daß der Heizer im Notfall mit der Kraft seiner Verzweiflung
alle anwesenden sieben Männer bezwingen könne. Allerdings lag auf dem
Schreibtisch, wie ein Blick dorthin lehrte, ein Aufsatz mit viel zu
vielen Druckknöpfen der elektrischen Leitung; und eine Hand, einfach auf
sie niedergedrückt, konnte das ganze Schiff mit allen seinen von
feindlichen Menschen gefüllten Gängen rebellisch machen. Da trat der
doch so uninteressierte Herr mit dem Bambusstöckchen auf Karl zu und
fragte, nicht überlaut, aber deutlich über allem Geschrei des Heizers:
»Wie heißen Sie denn eigentlich?« In diesem Augenblick, als hätte jemand
hinter der Tür auf diese Äußerung des Herrn gewartet, klopfte es. Der
Diener sah zum Kapitän hinüber, dieser nickte. Daher ging der Diener zur
Tür und öffnete sie. Draußen stand in einem alten Kaiserrock ein Mann
von mittleren Proportionen, seinem Ansehen nach nicht eigentlich zur
Arbeit an den Maschinen geeignet, und war doch - Schubal. Wenn es Karl
nicht an aller Augen erkannt hätte, die eine gewisse Befriedigung
ausdrückten, von der nicht einmal der Kapitän frei war, er hätte es zu
seinem Schrecken am Heizer sehen müssen, der die Fäuste an den
gestrafften Armen so ballte, als sei diese Ballung das Wichtigste an
ihm, dem er alles, was er an Leben habe, zu opfern bereit sei. Da
steckte jetzt alle seine Kraft, auch die, welche ihn überhaupt aufrecht
erhielt. Und da war also der Feind, frei und frisch im Festanzug, unter
dem Arm ein Geschäftsbuch, wahrscheinlich die Lohnlisten und
Arbeitsausweise des Heizers, und sah mit dem ungescheuten Zugeständnis,
daß er die Stimmung jedes einzelnen vor allem feststellen wolle, in
aller Augen der Reihe nach. Die sieben waren auch schon alle seine
Freunde, denn wenn auch der Kapitän früher gewisse Einwände gegen ihn
gehabt oder vielleicht nur vorgeschützt hatte, nach dem Leid, das ihm
der Heizer angetan hatte, schien ihm wahrscheinlich an Schubal auch das
geringste nicht mehr auszusetzen. Gegen einen Mann wie den Heizer konnte
man nicht streng genug verfahren, und wenn dem Schubal etwas vorzuwerfen
war, so war es der Umstand, daß er die Widerspenstigkeit des Heizers im
Laufe der Zeit nicht so weit hatte brechen können, daß es dieser heute
noch gewagt hatte, vor dem Kapitän zu erscheinen. Nun konnte man ja
vielleicht noch annehmen, die Gegenüberstellung des Heizers und Schubals
werde die ihr vor einem höheren Forum zukommende Wirkung auch vor den
Menschen nicht verfehlen, denn wenn sich auch Schubal gut verstellen
konnte, er mußte es doch durchaus nicht bis zum Ende aushalten können.
Ein kurzes Aufblitzen seiner Schlechtigkeit sollte genügen, um sie den
Herren sichtbar zu machen, dafür wollte Karl schon sorgen. Er kannte
doch schon beiläufig den Scharfsinn, die Schwächen, die Launen der
einzelnen Herren, und unter diesem Gesichtspunkt war die bisher hier
verbrachte Zeit nicht verloren. Wenn nur der Heizer besser auf dem Platz
gewesen wäre, aber der schien vollständig kampfunfähig. Wenn man ihm den
Schubal hingehalten hätte, hätte er wohl dessen gehaßten Schädel mit den
Fäusten aufklopfen können. Aber schon die paar Schritte zu ihm
hinzugehen, war er wohl kaum imstande. Warum hatte denn Karl das so
leicht Vorauszusehende nicht vorausgesehen, daß Schubal endlich kommen
müsse, wenn nicht aus eigenem Antrieb, so vom Kapitän gerufen? Warum
hatte er auf dem Herweg mit dem Heizer nicht einen genauen Kriegsplan
besprochen, statt, wie sie es in Wirklichkeit getan hatten, heillos
unvorbereitet einfach dort einzutreten, wo eine Tür war? Konnte der
Heizer überhaupt noch reden, ja und nein sagen, wie es bei dem
Kreuzverhör, das allerdings nur im günstigsten Fall bevorstand, nötig
sein würde? Er stand da, die Beine auseinandergestellt, die Knie
unsicher, den Kopf etwas gehoben, und die Luft verkehrte durch den
offenen Mund, als gäbe es innen keine Lungen mehr, die sie
verarbeiteten. Karl allerdings fühlte sich so kräftig und bei Verstand,
wie er es vielleicht zu Hause niemals gewesen war. Wenn ihn doch seine
Eltern sehen könnten, wie er in fremdem Land vor angesehenen
Persönlichkeiten das Gute verfocht und, wenn er es auch noch nicht zum
Siege gebracht hatte, so doch zur letzten Eroberung sich vollkommen
bereitstellte! Würden sie ihre Meinung über ihn revidieren? Ihn zwischen
sich niedersetzen und loben? Ihm einmal, einmal in die ihnen so
ergebenen Augen sehn? Unsichere Fragen und ungeeignetster Augenblick,
sie zu stellen! »Ich komme, weil ich glaube, daß mich der Heizer
irgendwelcher Unredlichkeiten beschuldigt. Ein Mädchen aus der Küche
sagte mir, sie hätte ihn auf dem Wege hierher gesehen. Herr Kapitän und
Sie alle meine Herren, ich bin bereit, jede Beschuldigung an der Hand
meiner Schriften, nötigenfalls durch Aussagen unvoreingenommener und
unbeeinflußter Zeugen, die vor der Türe stehen, zu widerlegen.« So
sprach Schubal. Das war allerdings die klare Rede eines Mannes, und nach
der Veränderung in den Mienen der Zuhörer hätte man glauben können, sie
hörten zum erstenmal nach langer Zeit wieder menschliche Laute. Sie
bemerkten freilich nicht, daß selbst diese schöne Rede Löcher hatte.
Warum war das erste sachliche Wort, das ihm einfiel, »Unredlichkeiten«?
Hätte vielleicht die Beschuldigung hier einsetzen müssen, statt bei
seinen nationalen Voreingenommenheiten? Ein Mädchen aus der Küche hatte
den Heizer auf dem Weg ins Büro gesehen, und Schubal hatte sofort
begriffen? War es nicht das Schuldbewußtsein, das ihm den Verstand
schärfte? Und Zeugen hatte er gleich mitgebracht und nannte sie noch
außerdem unvoreingenommen und unbeeinflußt? Gaunerei, nichts als
Gaunerei! Und die Herren duldeten das und anerkannten es noch als
richtiges Benehmen? Warum hatte er zweifellos sehr viel Zeit zwischen
der Meldung des Küchenmädchens und seiner Ankunft hier verstreichen
lassen? Doch zu keinem anderen Zwecke, als damit der Heizer die Herren
so ermüde, daß sie allmählich ihre klare Urteilskraft verlören, welche
Schubal vor allem zu fürchten hatte. Hatte er, der sicher schon lange
hinter der Tür gestanden, nicht erst im Augenblick geklopft, als er
infolge der nebensächlichen Frage jenes Herrn hoffen durfte, der Heizer
sei erledigt? Alles war klar und wurde ja auch von Schubal wider Willen
so dargeboten, aber den Herren mußte man es anders, noch handgreiflicher
zeigen. Sie brauchen Aufrüttelung. Also, Karl, rasch, nütze wenigstens
die Zeit aus, ehe die Zeugen auftreten und alles überschwemmen! Eben
aber winkte der Kapitän dem Schubal ab, der daraufhin sofort - denn
seine Angelegenheit schien für ein Weilchen aufgeschoben zu sein -
beiseitetrat und mit dem Diener, der sich ihm gleich angeschlossen
hatte, eine leise Unterhaltung begann, bei der es an Seitenblicken nach
dem Heizer und Karl sowie an den überzeugtesten Handbewegungen nicht
fehlte. Schubal schien so seine nächste Rede einzuüben. »Wollten Sie
nicht den jungen Menschen etwas fragen, Herr Jakob?« sagte der Kapitän
unter allgemeiner Stille zu dem Herrn mit dem Bambusstöckchen.
»Allerdings«, sagte dieser, mit einer kleinen Neigung für die
Aufmerksamkeit dankend. Und fragte dann Karl nochmals: »Wie heißen Sie
eigentlich?” Karl, welcher glaubte, es sei im Interesse der großen
Hauptsache gelegen, wenn dieser Zwischenfall des hartnäckigen Fragers
bald erledigt würde, antwortete kurz, ohne, wie es seine Gewohnheit war,
durch Vorweisung des Passes sich vorzustellen, den er erst hätte suchen
müssen: »Karl Roßmann.« »Aber«, sagte der mit Jakob Angesprochene und
trat zuerst fast ungläubig lächelnd zurück. Auch der Kapitän, der
Oberkassier, der Schiffsoffizier, ja sogar der Diener zeigten deutlich
ein übermäßiges Erstaunen wegen Karls Namen. Nur die Herren von der
Hafenbehörde und Schubal verhielten sich gleichmütig. »Aber«,
wiederholte Herr Jakob und trat mit etwas steifen Schritten auf Karl zu,
»dann bin ich ja dein Onkel Jakob, und du bist mein lieber Neffe. Ahnte
ich es doch die ganze Zeit über!« sagte er zum Kapitän hin, ehe er Karl
umarmte und küßte, der alles stumm geschehen ließ. »Wie heißen Sie?«
fragte Karl, nachdem er sich losgelassen fühlte, zwar sehr höflich, aber
gänzlich ungerührt, und strengte sich an, die Folgen abzusehen, welche
dieses neue Ereignis für den Heizer haben dürfte. Vorläufig deutete
nichts darauf hin, daß Schubal aus dieser Sache Nutzen ziehen könnte.
»Begreifen Sie doch, junger Mann, Ihr Glück«, sagte der Kapitän, der
durch Karls Frage die Würde der Person des Herrn Jakob verletzt glaubte,
der sich zum Fenster gestellt hatte, offenbar, um sein aufgeregtes
Gesicht, das er überdies mit einem Taschentuch betupfte, den andern
nicht zeigen zu müssen. »Es ist der Senator Edward Jakob, der sich Ihnen
als Ihr Onkel zu erkennen gegeben hat. Es erwartet Sie nunmehr, doch
wohl ganz gegen Ihre bisherigen Erwartungen, eine glänzende Laufbahn.
Versuchen Sie das einzusehen, so gut es im Augenblick geht, und fassen
Sie sich!« »Ich habe allerdings einen Onkel Jakob in Amerika«, sagte
Karl zum Kapitän gewendet, »aber wenn ich recht verstanden habe, ist
Jakob bloß der Zuname des Herrn Senators. »So ist es«, sagte der Kapitän
würdevoll. »Nun, mein Onkel Jakob, welcher der Bruder meiner Mutter ist,
heißt aber mit dem Taufnamen Jakob, während sein Zuname natürlich gleich
jenem meiner Mutter lauten müßte, welche eine geborene Bendelmayer ist.«
»Meine Herren!« rief der Senator, der von seinem Erholungsposten vom
Fenster munter zurückkehrte, mit Bezug auf Karls Erklärung aus. Alle mit
Ausnahme des Hafenbeamten brachen in Lachen aus, manche wie in Rührung,
manche undurchdringlich. »So lächerlich war das, was ich gesagt habe,
doch keineswegs« dachte Karl. »Meine Herren«, wiederholte der Senator,
»Sie nehmen gegen meinen und gegen Ihren Willen an einer kleinen
Familienszene teil, und ich kann deshalb nicht umhin, Ihnen eine
Erläuterung zu geben, da, wie ich glaube, nur der Herr Kapitän« - diese
Erwähnung hatte eine gegenseitige Verbeugung zur Folge - »vollständig
unterrichtet ist.« &gt;Jetzt muß ich aber wirklich auf jedes Wort
achtgeben&lt;, sagte sich Karl und freute sich, als er bei einem
Seitwärtsschauen bemerkte, daß in die Figur des Heizers das Leben
zurückzukehren begann. »Ich lebe seit allen den langen Jahren meines
amerikanischen Aufenthaltes - das Wort Aufenthalt paßt hier allerdings
schlecht für den amerikanischen Bürger, der ich mit ganzer Seele bin -,
seit allen den langen Jahren lebe ich also von meinen europäischen
Verwandten vollständig getrennt, aus Gründen, die erstens nicht
hierhergehören und die zweitens zu erzählen mich wirklich zu sehr
hernehmen würde. Ich fürchte mich sogar vor dem Augenblick, wo ich
vielleicht gezwungen sein werde, sie meinem lieben Neffen zu erzählen,
wobei sich leider ein offenes Wort über seine Eltern und ihren Anhang
nicht vermeiden lassen wird.« &gt;Er ist mein Onkel, kein Zweifel&lt;,
sagte sich Karl und lauschte, &gt;wahrscheinlich hat er seinen Namen
ändern lassen.&lt; »Mein lieber Neffe ist nun von seinen Eltern - sagen
wir nur das Wort, das die Sache auch wirklich bezeichnet - einfach
beiseitegeschafft worden, wie man eine Katze vor die Tür wirft, wenn sie
ärgert. Ich will durchaus nicht beschönigen, was mein Neffe gemacht hat,
daß er so gestraft wurde, aber sein Verschulden ist ein solches, daß
sein einfaches Nennen schon genug Entschuldigung enthält.« &gt;Das läßt
sich hören&lt;, dachte Karl, &gt;aber ich will nicht, daß er alles
erzählt. Übrigens kann er es ja auch nicht wissen. Woher denn?&lt; »Er
wurde nämlich«, fuhr der Onkel fort und stützte sich mit kleinen
Neigungen auf das vor ihm eingestemmte Bambusstäbchen, wodurch es ihm
tatsächlich gelang, der Sache die unnötige Feierlichkeit zu nehmen, die
sie sonst unbedingt gehabt hätte, »er wurde nämlich von einem
Dienstmädchen, Johanna Brummer, einer etwa fünfunddreißigjährigen
Person, verführt. Ich will mit dem Worte &gt;verführt&lt; meinen Neffen
durchaus nicht kränken, aber es ist doch schwer, ein anderes, gleich
passendes Wort zu finden.« Karl, der schon ziemlich nahe zum Onkel
getreten war, drehte sich um, um den Eindruck der Erzählung von den
Gesichtern der Anwesenden abzulesen. Keiner lachte, alle hörten geduldig
und ernsthaft zu. Schließlich lacht man auch nicht über den Neffen eines
Senators bei der ersten Gelegenheit, die sich darbietet. Eher hätte man
schon sagen können, daß der Heizer, wenn auch nur ganz wenig, Karl
anlächelte, was aber erstens als neues Lebenszeichen erfreulich und
zweitens entschuldbar war, da ja Karl in der Kabine aus dieser Sache,
die jetzt so publik wurde, ein besonderes Geheimnis hatte machen wollen.
»Nun hat diese Brummer«, setzte der Onkel fort, »von meinem Neffen ein
Kind bekommen, einen gesunden Jungen, welcher in der Taufe den Namen
Jakob erhielt, zweifellos in Gedanken an meine Wenigkeit, welche, selbst
in den sicher nur ganz nebensächlichen Erwähnungen meines Neffen, auf
das Mädchen einen großen Eindruck gemacht haben muß. Glücklicherweise,
sage ich. Denn da die Eltern zur Vermeidung der Alimentenzahlung oder
sonstigen bis an sie selbst heranreichenden Skandals - ich kenne, wie
ich betonen muß, weder die dortigen Gesetze noch die sonstigen
Verhältnisse der Eltern -, da sie also zur Vermeidung der
Alimentenzahlung und des Skandals ihren Sohn, meinen lieben Neffen, nach
Amerika haben transportieren lassen, mit unverantwortlich ungenügender
Ausrüstung, wie man sieht, so wäre der Junge, ohne die gerade noch in
Amerika lebendigen Zeichen und Wunder, auf sich allein angewiesen, wohl
schon gleich in einem Gäßchen im Hafen von New York verkommen, wenn
nicht jenes Dienstmädchen in einem an mich gerichteten Brief, der nach
langen Irrfahrten vorgestern in meinen Besitz kam, mir die ganze
Geschichte samt Personenbeschreibung meines Neffen und vernünftigerweise
auch Namensnennung des Schiffes mitgeteilt hätte. Wenn ich es darauf
angelegt hätte, Sie, meine Herren, zu unterhalten, könnte ich wohl
einige Stellen jenes Briefes« - er zog zwei riesige engbeschriebene
Briefbogen aus der Tasche und schwenkte sie - »hier vorlesen. Er würde
sicher Wirkung machen, da er mit einer etwas einfachen, wenn auch immer
gutgemeinten Schlauheit und mit viel Liebe zu dem Vater des Kindes
geschrieben ist. Aber ich will weder Sie mehr unterhalten, als es zur
Aufklärung nötig ist, noch vielleicht gar zum Empfang möglicherweise
noch bestehende Gefühle meines Neffen verletzen, der den Brief, wenn er
mag, in der Stille seines ihn schon erwartenden Zimmers zur Belehrung
lesen kann.« Karl hatte aber keine Gefühle für jenes Mädchen. Im
Gedränge einer immer mehr zurücktretenden Vergangenheit saß sie in ihrer
Küche neben dem Küchenschrank, auf dessen Platte sie ihren Ellbogen
stützte. Sie sah ihn an, wenn er hin und wieder in die Küche kam, um ein
Glas zum Wassertrinken für seinen Vater zu holen oder einen Auftrag
seiner Mutter auszurichten. Manchmal schrieb sie in der vertrackten
Stellung seitlich vom Küchenschrank einen Brief und holte sich die
Eingebungen von Karls Gesicht. Manchmal hielt sie die Augen mit der Hand
verdeckt, dann drang keine Anrede zu ihr. Manchmal kniete sie in ihrem
engen Zimmerchen neben der Küche und betete zu einem hölzernen Kreuz;
Karl beobachtete sie dann nur mit Scheu im Vorübergehen durch die Spalte
der ein wenig geöffneten Tür. Manchmal jagte sie in der Küche herum und
fuhr, wie eine Hexe lachend, zurück, wenn Karl ihr in den Weg kam.
Manchmal schloß sie die Küchentüre, wenn Karl eingetreten war, und
behielt die Klinke so lange in der Hand, bis er wegzugehen verlangte.
Manchmal holte sie Sachen, die er gar nicht haben wollte, und drückte
sie ihm schweigend in die Hände. Einmal aber sagte sie »Karl« und führte
ihn, der noch über die unerwartete Ansprache staunte, unter Grimassen
seufzend in ihr Zimmerchen, das sie zusperrte. Würgend umarmte sie
seinen Hals, und während sie ihn bat, sie zu entkleiden, entkleidete sie
in Wirklichkeit ihn und legte ihn in ihr Bett, als wolle sie ihn von
jetzt niemandem mehr lassen und ihn streicheln und pflegen bis zum Ende
der Welt. »Karl, o du mein Karl!« rief sie, als sähe sie ihn und
bestätigte sich seinen Besitz, während er nicht das geringste sah und
sich unbehaglich in dem vielen warmen Bettzeug fühlte, das sie eigens
für ihn aufgehäuft zu haben schien. Dann legte sie sich auch zu ihm und
wollte irgendwelche Geheimnisse von ihm erfahren, aber er konnte ihr
keine sagen, und sie ärgerte sich im Scherz oder Ernst, schüttelte ihn,
horchte sein Herz ab, bot ihre Brust zum gleichen Abhorchen hin, wozu
sie Karl aber nicht bringen konnte, drückte ihren nackten Bauch an
seinen Leib, suchte mit der Hand, so widerlich, daß Karl Kopf und Hals
aus den Kissen herausschüttelte, zwischen seinen Beinen, stieß dann den
Bauch einige Male gegen ihn - ihm war, als sei sie ein Teil seiner
Selbst, und vielleicht aus diesem Grunde hatte ihn eine entsetzliche
Hilfsbedürftigkeit ergriffen. Weinend kam er endlich nach vielen
Wiedersehenswünschen ihrerseits in sein Bett. Das war alles gewesen, und
doch verstand es der Onkel, daraus eine große Geschichte zu machen. Und
die Köchin hatte also auch an ihn gedacht und den Onkel von seiner
Ankunft verständigt. Das war schön von ihr gehandelt, und er würde es
ihr wohl noch einmal vergelten. »Und jetzt«, rief der Senator, »will ich
von dir offen hören, ob ich dein Onkel bin oder nicht.« »Du bist mein
Onkel«, sagte Karl und küßte ihm die Hand und wurde dafür auf die Stirne
geküßt. »Ich bin sehr froh, daß ich dich getroffen habe, aber du irrst,
wenn du glaubst, daß meine Eltern nur Schlechtes von dir reden. Aber
auch abgesehen davon sind in deiner Rede einige Fehler enthalten
gewesen, das heißt, ich meine, es hat sich in Wirklichkeit nicht alles
so zugetragen. Du kannst aber auch wirklich von hier aus die Dinge nicht
so gut beurteilen, und ich glaube außerdem, daß es keinen besonderen
Schaden bringen wird, wenn die Herren in Einzelheiten einer Sache, an
der ihnen doch wirklich nicht viel liegen kann, ein wenig unrichtig
informiert worden sind.« »Wohl gesprochen«, sagte der Senator, führte
Karl vor den sichtlich teilnehmenden Kapitän und fragte: »Habe ich nicht
einen prächtigen Neffen?« »Ich bin glücklich«, sagte der Kapitän mit
einer Verbeugung, wie sie nur militärisch geschulte Leute
zustandebringen, »Ihren Neffen, Herr Senator, kennengelernt zu haben. Es
ist eine besondere Ehre für mein Schiff, daß es den Ort eines solchen
Zusammentreffens abgeben konnte. Aber die Fahrt im Zwischendeck war wohl
sehr arg, ja, wer kann denn wissen, wer da mitgeführt wird. Nun, wir tun
alles mögliche, den Leuten im Zwischendeck die Fahrt möglichst zu
erleichtern, viel mehr zum Beispiel als die amerikanischen Linien, aber
eine solche Fahrt zu einem Vergnügen zu machen, ist uns allerdings noch
immer nicht gelungen.« »Es hat mir nicht geschadet«, sagte Karl. »Es hat
ihm nicht geschadet!« wiederholte laut lachend der Senator. »Nur meinen
Koffer fürchte ich verloren zu -« und damit erinnerte er sich an alles,
was geschehen und was noch zu tun übrigblieb, sah sich um und erblickte
alle Anwesenden stumm vor Achtung und Staunen auf ihren früheren
Plätzen, die Augen auf ihn gerichtet. Nur den Hafenbeamten sah man,
soweit ihre strengen, selbstzufriedenen Gesichter einen Einblick
gestatteten, das Bedauern an, zu so ungelegener Zeit gekommen zu sein,
und die Taschenuhr, die sie jetzt vor sich liegen hatten, war ihnen
wahrscheinlich wichtiger als alles, was im Zimmer vorging und vielleicht
noch geschehen konnte. Der erste, welcher nach dem Kapitän seine
Anteilnahme ausdrückte, war merkwürdigerweise der Heizer. »Ich
gratuliere Ihnen herzlich«, sagte er und schüttelte Karl die Hand, womit
er auch etwas wie Anerkennung ausdrücken wollte. Als er sich dann mit
der gleichen Ansprache auch an den Senator wenden wollte, trat dieser
zurück, als überschreite der Heizer damit seine Rechte; der Heizer ließ
auch sofort ab. Die übrigen aber sahen jetzt ein, was zu tun war, und
bildeten gleich um Karl und den Senator einen Wirrwarr. So geschah es,
daß Karl sogar eine Gratulation Schubals erhielt, annahm und für sie
dankte. Als letzte traten in der wieder entstandenen Ruhe die
Hafenbeamten hinzu und sagten zwei englische Worte, was einen
lächerlichen Eindruck machte. Der Senator war ganz in der Laune, um das
Vergnügen vollständig auszukosten, nebensächlichere Momente sich und den
anderen in Erinnerung zu bringen, was natürlich von allen nicht nur
geduldet, sondern mit Interesse hingenommen wurde. So machte er darauf
aufmerksam, daß er sich die in dem Brief der Köchin erwähnten
hervorstechendsten Erkennungszeichen Karls in sein Notizbuch zu
möglicherweise notwendigem augenblicklichem Gebrauch eingetragen hatte.
Nun hatte er während des unerträglichen Geschwätzes des Heizers zu
keinem anderen Zweck, als um sich abzulenken, das Notizbuch
herausgezogen und die natürlich nicht gerade detektivisch richtigen
Beobachtungen der Köchin mit Karls Aussehen zum Spiel in Verbindung zu
bringen gesucht. »Und so findet man seinen Neffen!« schloß er in einem
Ton, als wolle er noch einmal Gratulation bekommen. »Was wird jetzt mit
dem Heizer geschehen?« fragte Karl vorbei an der letzten Erzählung des
Onkels. Er glaubte in seiner neuen Stellung alles, was er dachte, auch
aussprechen zu können. »Dem Heizer wird geschehen, was er verdient«,
sagte der Senator, »und was der Herr Kapitän für gut erachtet. Ich
glaube, wir haben von dem Heizer genug und übergenug, wozu mir jeder der
anwesenden Herren sicher zustimmen wird.« »Darauf kommt es doch nicht
an, bei einer Sache der Gerechtigkeit«, sagte Karl. Er stand zwischen
dem Onkel und dem Kapitän und glaubte, vielleicht durch diese Stellung
beeinflußt, die Entscheidung in der Hand zu haben. Und trotzdem schien
der Heizer nichts mehr für sich zu hoffen. Die Hände hielt er halb in
dem Hosengürtel, der durch seine aufgeregten Bewegungen mit dem Streifen
eines gemusterten Hemdes zum Vorschein gekommen war. Das kümmerte ihn
nicht im geringsten; er hatte sein ganzes Leid geklagt, nun sollte man
auch noch die paar Fetzen sehen, die er am Leibe hatte, und dann sollte
man ihn forttragen. Er dachte sich aus, der Diener und Schubal, als die
zwei hier im Range Tiefsten, sollten ihm diese letzte Güte erweisen.
Schubal würde dann Ruhe haben und nicht mehr in Verzweiflung kommen, wie
sich der Oberkassier ausgedrückt hatte. Der Kapitän würde lauter Rumänen
anstellen können, es würde überall Rumänisch gesprochen werden, und
vielleicht würde dann wirklich alles besser gehen. Kein Heizer würde
mehr in der Hauptkassa schwätzen, nur sein letztes Geschwätz würde man
in ziemlich freundlicher Erinnerung behalten, das, wie der Senator
ausdrücklich erklärt hatte, die mittelbare Veranlassung zur Erkennung
des Neffen gegeben hatte. Dieser Neffe hatte ihm übrigens vorher öfters
zu nützen gesucht und daher für seinen Dienst bei der Wiedererkennung
längst vorher einen mehr als genügenden Dank abgestattet; dem Heizer
fiel gar nicht ein, jetzt noch etwas von ihm zu verlangen. Im übrigen,
mochte er auch der Neffe des Senators sein, ein Kapitän war er noch
lange nicht, aber aus dem Munde des Kapitäns würde schließlich das böse
Wort fallen. - So wie es seiner Meinung entsprach, versuchte auch der
Heizer, nicht zu Karl hinzusehen, aber leider blieb in diesem Zimmer der
Feinde kein anderer Ruheort für seine Augen. »Mißverstehe die Sachlage
nicht«, sagte der Senator zu Karl, »es handelt sich vielleicht um eine
Sache der Gerechtigkeit, aber gleichzeitig um eine Sache der Disziplin.
Beides und ganz besonders das letztere unterliegt hier der Beurteilung
des Herrn Kapitäns.« »So ist es«, murmelte der Heizer. Wer es merkte und
verstand, lächelte befremdet. »Wir aber haben überdies den Herrn Kapitän
in seinen Amtsgeschäften, die sich sicher gerade bei der Ankunft in New
York unglaublich häufen, so sehr schon behindert, daß es höchste Zeit
für uns ist, das Schiff zu verlassen, um nicht zum Überfluß auch noch
durch irgendwelche höchst unnötige Einmischung diese geringfügige
Zänkerei zweier Maschinisten zu einem Ereignis zu machen. Ich begreife
deine Handlungsweise, lieber Neffe, übrigens vollkommen, aber gerade das
gibt mir das Recht, dich eilends von hier fortzuführen.« »Ich werde
sofort ein Boot für Sie flottmachen lassen«, sagte der Kapitän, ohne zum
Erstaunen Karls auch nur den kleinsten Einwand gegen die Worte des
Onkels vorzubringen, die doch zweifellos als eine Selbstdemütigung des
Onkels angesehen werden konnten. Der Oberkassier eilte überstürzt zum
Schreibtisch und telephonierte den Befehl des Kapitäns an den
Bootsmeister. &gt;Die Zeit drängt schon&lt;, sagte sich Karl, &gt;aber
ohne alle zu beleidigen, kann ich nichts tun. Ich kann doch jetzt den
Onkel nicht verlassen, nachdem er mich kaum wiedergefunden hat. Der
Kapitän ist zwar höflich, aber das ist auch alles. Bei der Disziplin
hört seine Höflichkeit auf, und der Onkel hat ihm sicher aus der Seele
gesprochen. Mit Schubal will ich nicht reden, es tut mir sogar leid, daß
ich ihm die Hand gereicht habe. Und alle anderen Leute hier sind
Spreu.&lt; Und er ging langsam in solchen Gedanken zum Heizer, zog
dessen rechte Hand aus dem Gürtel und hielt sie spielend in der seinen.
»Warum sagst du denn nichts?« fragte er. »Warum läßt du dir alles
gefallen?« Der Heizer legte nur die Stirn in Falten, als suche er den
Ausdruck für das, was er zu sagen habe. Im übrigen sah er auf Karls und
seine Hand hinab. »Dir ist ja unrecht geschehen wie keinem auf dem
Schiff, das weiß ich genau.« Und Karl zog seine Finger hin und her
zwischen den Fingern des Heizers, der mit glänzenden Augen ringsumher
schaute, als widerfahre ihm eine Wonne, die ihm aber niemand verübeln
möge. »Du mußt dich aber zur Wehr setzen, ja und nein sagen, sonst haben
doch die Leute keine Ahnung von der Wahrheit. Du mußt mir versprechen,
daß du mir folgen wirst, denn ich selbst, das fürchte ich mit vielem
Grund, werde dir gar nicht mehr helfen können.« Und nun weinte Karl,
während er die Hand des Heizers küßte, und nahm die rissige, fast
leblose Hand und drückte sie an seine Wangen, wie einen Schatz, auf den
man verzichten muß. - Da war aber auch schon der Onkel Senator an seiner
Seite und zog ihn, wenn auch nur mit dem leichtesten Zwange, fort. »Der
Heizer scheint dich bezaubert zu haben,« sagte er und sah
verständnisinnig über Karls Kopf zum Kapitän hin. »Du hast dich
verlassen gefühlt, da hast du den Heizer gefunden und bist ihm jetzt
dankbar, das ist ja ganz löblich. Treibe das aber, schon mir zuliebe,
nicht zu weit und lerne deine Stellung begreifen.« Vor der Tür entstand
ein Lärmen, man hörte Rufe, und es war sogar, als werde jemand brutal
gegen die Türe gestoßen. Ein Matrose trat ein, etwas verwildert, und
hatte eine Mädchenschürze umgebunden. »Es sind Leute draußen«, rief er
und stieß einmal mit dem Ellbogen herum, als sei er noch im Gedränge.
Endlich fand er seine Besinnung und wollte vor dem Kapitän salutieren,
da bemerkte er die Mädchenschürze, riß sie herunter, warf sie zu Boden
und rief: »Das ist ja ekelhaft, da haben sie mir eine Mädchenschürze
umgebunden.« Dann aber klappte er die Hacken zusammen und salutierte.
Jemand versuchte zu lachen, aber der Kapitän sagte streng: »Das nenne
ich eine gute Laune. Wer ist denn draußen?« »Es sind meine Zeugen«,
sagte Schubal vortretend, »ich bitte ergebenst um Entschuldigung für ihr
unpassendes Benehmen. Wenn die Leute die Seefahrt hinter sich haben,
sind sie manchmal wie toll.« »Rufen Sie sie sofort herein!« befahl der
Kapitän, und gleich sich zum Senator umwendend, sagte er verbindlich,
aber rasch: »Haben Sie jetzt die Güte, verehrter Herr Senator, mit Ihrem
Herrn Neffen diesem Matrosen zu folgen, der Sie ins Boot bringen wird.
Ich muß wohl nicht erst sagen, welches Vergnügen und welche Ehre mir das
persönliche Bekanntwerden mit Ihnen, Herr Senator, bereitet hat. Ich
wünsche mir nur, bald Gelegenheit zu haben, mit Ihnen, Herr Senator,
unser unterbrochenes Gespräch über die amerikanischen
Flottenverhältnisse wieder einmal aufnehmen zu können und dann
vielleicht neuerdings auf so angenehme Weise, wie heute, unterbrochen zu
werden.« »Vorläufig genügt mir dieser eine Neffe«, sagte der Onkel
lachend. »Und nun nehmen Sie meinen besten Dank für Ihre
Liebenswürdigkeit und leben Sie wohl. Es wäre übrigens gar nicht so
unmöglich, daß wir« - er drückte Karl herzlich an sich - »bei unserer
nächsten Europareise vielleicht für längere Zeit mit Ihnen
zusammenkommen könnten.« »Es würde mich herzlich freuen«, sagte der
Kapitän. Die beiden Herren schüttelten einander die Hände, Karl konnte
nur noch stumm und flüchtig seine Hand dem Kapitän reichen, denn dieser
war bereits von den vielleicht fünfzehn Leuten in Anspruch genommen,
welche unter Führung Schubals zwar etwas betroffen, aber doch sehr laut
einzogen. Der Matrose bat den Senator, vorausgehen zu dürfen, und teilte
dann die Menge für ihn und Karl, die leicht zwischen den sich
verbeugenden Leuten durchkamen. Es schien, daß diese im übrigen
gutmütigen Leute den Streit Schubals mit dem Heizer als einen Spaß
auffaßten, dessen Lächerlichkeit nicht einmal vor dem Kapitän aufhöre.
Karl bemerkte unter ihnen auch das Küchenmädchen Line, welche, ihm
lustig zuzwinkernd, die vom Matrosen hingeworfene Schürze umband, denn
es war die ihre. Weiter dem Matrosen folgend, verließen sie das Büro und
bogen in einen kleinen Gang ein, der sie nach ein paar Schritten zu
einem Türchen brachte, von dem aus eine kurze Treppe in das Boot
hinabführte, welches für sie vorbereitet war. Die Matrosen im Boot, in
das ihr Führer gleich mit einem einzigen Satz hinuntersprang, erhoben
sich und salutierten. Der Senator gab Karl gerade eine Ermahnung zu
vorsichtigem Hinuntersteigen, als Karl noch auf der obersten Stufe in
heftiges Weinen ausbrach. Der Senator legte die rechte Hand unter Karls
Kinn, hielt ihn fest an sich gepreßt und streichelte ihn mit der linken
Hand. So gingen sie langsam Stufe für Stufe hinab und traten
engverbunden ins Boot, wo der Senator für Karl gerade sich gegenüber
einen guten Platz aussuchte. Auf ein Zeichen des Senators stießen die
Matrosen vom Schiffe ab und waren gleich in voller Arbeit. Kaum waren
sie ein paar Meter vom Schiffe entfernt, machte Karl die unerwartete
Entdeckung, daß sie sich gerade auf jener Seite des Schiffes befanden,
wohin die Fenster der Hauptkassa gingen. Alle drei Fenster waren mit
Zeugen Schubals besetzt, welche freundschaftlich grüßten und winkten,
sogar der Onkel dankte, und ein Matrose machte das Kunststück, ohne
eigentlich das gleichmäßige Rudern zu unterbrechen, eine Kußhand
hinaufzuschicken. Es war wirklich, als gäbe es keinen Heizer mehr. Karl
faßte den Onkel, mit dessen Knien sich die seinen fast berührten,
genauer ins Auge, und es kamen ihm Zweifel, ob dieser Mann ihm jemals
den Heizer werde ersetzen können. Auch wich der Onkel seinem Blicke aus
und sah auf die Wellen hin, von denen ihr Boot umschwankt wurde. |
10112| 64044| |id179 |  Der Onkel  Im Hause des Onkels gewöhnte sich
Karl bald an die neuen Verhältnisse. Der Onkel kam ihm aber auch in
jeder Kleinigkeit freundlich entgegen, und niemals mußte Karl sich erst
durch schlechte Erfahrungen belehren lassen, wie dies meist das erste
Leben im Ausland so verbittert. Karls Zimmer lag im sechsten Stockwerk
eines Hauses, dessen fünf untere Stockwerke, an welche sich in der Tiefe
noch drei unterirdische anschlossen, von dem Geschäftsbetrieb des Onkels
eingenommen wurden. Das Licht, das in sein Zimmer durch zwei Fenster und
eine Balkontüre eindrang, brachte Karl immer wieder zum Staunen, wenn er
des Morgens aus seiner kleinen Schlafkammer hier eintrat. Wo hätte er
wohl wohnen müssen, wenn er als armer kleiner Einwanderer ans Land
gestiegen wäre? Ja, vielleicht hätte man ihn, was der Onkel nach seiner
Kenntnis der Einwanderungsgesetze sogar für sehr wahrscheinlich hielt,
gar nicht in die Vereinigten Staaten eingelassen, sondern ihn nach Hause
geschickt, ohne sich weiter darum zu kümmern, daß er keine Heimat mehr
hatte. Denn auf Mitleid durfte man hier nicht hoffen, und es war ganz
richtig, was Karl in dieser Hinsicht über Amerika gelesen hatte; nur die
Glücklichen schienen hier ihr Glück zwischen den unbekümmerten
Gesichtern ihrer Umgebung wahrhaft zu genießen. Ein schmaler Balkon zog
sich vor dem Zimmer seiner ganzen Länge nach hin. Was aber in der
Heimatstadt Karls wohl der höchste Aussichtspunkt gewesen wäre,
gestattete hier nicht viel mehr als den Überblick über eine Straße, die
zwischen zwei Reihen förmlich abgehackter Häuser gerade, und darum wie
fliehend, in die Ferne sich verlief, wo aus vielem Dunst die Formen
einer Kathedrale ungeheuer sich erhoben. Und morgens wie abends und in
den Träumen der Nacht vollzog sich auf dieser Straße ein immer
drängender Verkehr, der, von oben gesehen, sich als eine aus immer neuen
Anfängen ineinandergestreute Mischung von verzerrten menschlichen
Figuren und von Dächern der Fuhrwerke aller Art darstellte, von der aus
sich noch eine neue, vervielfältigte, wildere Mischung von Lärm, Staub
und Gerüchen erhob, und alles dieses wurde erfaßt und durchdrungen von
einem mächtigen Licht, das immer wieder von der Menge der Gegenstände
verstreut, fortgetragen und wieder eifrig herbeigebracht wurde und das
dem betörten Auge so körperlich erschien, als werde über dieser Straße
eine alles bedeckende Glasscheibe jeden Augenblick immer wieder mit
aller Kraft zerschlagen. Vorsichtig wie der Onkel in allem war, riet er
Karl, sich vorläufig ernsthaft nicht auf das geringste einzulassen. Er
sollte wohl alles prüfen und anschauen, aber sich nicht gefangennehmen
lassen. Die ersten Tage eines Europäers in Amerika seien ja einer Geburt
vergleichbar, und wenn man sich hier auch, damit nur Karl keine unnötige
Angst habe, rascher eingewöhne, als wenn man vom jenseits in die
menschliche Welt eintrete, so müsse man sich vor Augen halten, daß das
erste Urteil immer auf schwachen Füßen stehe und daß man sich dadurch
nicht vielleicht alle künftigen Urteile, mit deren Hilfe man ja hier
sein Leben weiterführen wolle, in Unordnung bringen lassen dürfe. Er
selbst habe Neuankömmlinge gekannt, die zum Beispiel, statt nach diesen
Grundsätzen sich zu verhalten, tagelang auf ihrem Balkon gestanden und
wie verlorene Schafe auf die Straße hinuntergesehen hätten. Das müsse
unbedingt verwirren! Diese einsame Untätigkeit, die sich in einen
arbeitsreichen New Yorker Tag verschaut, könne einem
Vergnügungsreisenden gestattet und vielleicht, wenn auch nicht
vorbehaltlos, angeraten werden, für einen, der hierbleiben wird, sei sie
ein Verderben, man könne in diesem Fall ruhig das Wort anwenden, wenn es
auch eine Übertreibung ist. Und tatsächlich verzog der Onkel ärgerlich
das Gesicht, wenn er bei einem seiner Besuche, die immer nur einmal
täglich, und zwar immer zu den verschiedensten Tageszeiten, erfolgten,
Karl auf dem Balkon antraf. Karl merkte das bald und versagte sich
infolgedessen das Vergnügen, auf dem Balkon zu stehen, nach Möglichkeit.
Es war ja auch bei weitem nicht das einzige Vergnügen, das er hatte. In
seinem Zimmer stand ein amerikanischer Schreibtisch bester Sorte, wie
sich ihn sein Vater seit Jahren gewünscht und auf den verschiedensten
Versteigerungen um einen ihm erreichbaren billigen Preis zu kaufen
gesucht hatte, ohne daß es ihm bei seinen kleinen Mitteln jemals
gelungen wäre. Natürlich war dieser Tisch mit jenen angeblich
amerikanischen Schreibtischen, wie sie sich auf europäischen
Versteigerungen herumtreiben, nicht zu vergleichen. Er hatte zum
Beispiel in seinem Aufsatz hundert Fächer verschiedenster Größe, und
selbst der Präsident der Union hätte für jeden seiner Akten einen
passenden Platz gefunden, aber außerdem war an der Seite ein Regulator,
und man konnte durch Drehen an einer Kurbel die verschiedensten
Umstellungen und Neueinrichtungen der Fächer nach Belieben und Bedarf
erreichen. Dünne Seitenwändchen senkten sich langsam und bildeten den
Boden neu sich erhebender oder die Decke neu aufsteigender Fächer; schon
nach einer Umdrehung hatte der Aufsatz ein ganz anderes Aussehen, und
alles ging, je nachdem man die Kurbel drehte, langsam oder unsinnig
rasch vor sich. Es war eine neueste Erfindung, erinnerte aber Karl sehr
lebhaft an die Krippenspiele, die zu Hause auf dem Christmarkt den
staunenden Kindern gezeigt wurden, und auch Karl war oft, in seine
Winterkleider eingepackt, davor gestanden und hatte ununterbrochen die
Kurbeldrehung, die ein alter Mann ausführte, mit den Wirkungen im
Krippenspiel verglichen, mit dem stockenden Vorwärtskommen der Heiligen
Drei Könige, dem Aufglänzen des Sternes und dem befangenen Leben im
heiligen Stall. Und immer war es ihm erschienen, als ob die Mutter, die
hinter ihm stand, nicht genau genug alle Ereignisse verfolge; er hatte
sie zu sich hingezogen, bis er sie an seinem Rücken fühlte, und hatte
ihr so lange mit lauten Ausrufen verborgenere Erscheinungen gezeigt,
vielleicht ein Häschen, das vorn im Gras abwechselnd Männchen machte und
sich dann wieder zum Lauf bereitete, bis die Mutter ihm den Mund zuhielt
und wahrscheinlich in ihre frühere Unachtsamkeit verfiel. Der Tisch war
freilich nicht dazu gemacht, nur an solche Dinge zu erinnern, aber in
der Geschichte der Erfindungen bestand wohl ein ähnlich undeutlicher
Zusammenhang wie in Karls Erinnerungen. Der Onkel war zum Unterschied
von Karl mit diesem Schreibtisch durchaus nicht einverstanden, nur hatte
er eben für Karl einen ordentlichen Schreibtisch kaufen wollen, und
solche Schreibtische waren jetzt sämtlich mit dieser Neueinrichtung
versehen, deren Vorzug auch darin bestand, bei älteren Schreibtischen
ohne große Kosten angebracht werden zu können. Immerhin unterließ der
Onkel nicht, Karl zu raten, den Regulator möglichst gar nicht zu
verwenden; um die Wirkung des Rates zu verstärken, behauptete der Onkel,
die Maschinerie sei sehr empfindlich, leicht zu verderben und die
Wiederherstellung sehr kostspielig. Es war nicht schwer einzusehen, daß
solche Bemerkungen nur Ausflüchte waren, wenn man sich auch andererseits
sagen mußte, daß der Regulator sehr leicht zu fixieren war, was der
Onkel jedoch nicht tat. In den ersten Tagen, an denen selbstverständlich
zwischen Karl und dem Onkel häufigere Aussprachen stattgefunden hatten,
hatte Karl auch erzählt, daß er zu Hause zwar wenig, aber gern Klavier
gespielt habe, was er allerdings lediglich mit den Anfangskenntnissen
hatte bestreiten können, die ihm die Mutter beigebracht hatte. Karl war
sich dessen wohl bewußt, daß eine solche Erzählung gleichzeitig die
Bitte um ein Klavier war, aber er hatte sich schon genügend umgesehen,
um zu wissen, daß der Onkel auf keine Weise zu sparen brauchte. Trotzdem
wurde ihm diese Bitte nicht gleich gewährt, aber etwa acht Tage später
sagte der Onkel, fast in der Form eines widerwilligen Eingeständnisses,
das Klavier sei eben angelangt und Karl könne, wenn er wolle, den
Transport überwachen. Das war allerdings eine leichte Arbeit, aber dabei
nicht einmal viel leichter als der Transport selbst, denn im Haus war
ein eigener Möbelaufzug, in welchem ohne Gedränge ein ganzer Möbelwagen
Platz finden konnte, und in diesem Aufzug schwebte auch das Piano zu
Karls Zimmer hinauf. Karl selbst hätte zwar in dem gleichen Aufzug mit
dem Piano und den Transportarbeitern fahren können, aber da gleich
daneben ein Personenaufzug zur Benützung freistand, fuhr er in diesem,
hielt sich mittels eines Hebels stets in gleicher Höhe mit dem anderen
Aufzug und betrachtete unverwandt durch die Glaswände das schöne
Instrument, das jetzt sein Eigentum war. Als er es in seinem Zimmer
hatte und die ersten Töne anschlug, bekam er eine so närrische Freude,
daß er, statt weiterzuspielen, aufsprang und aus einiger Entfernung, die
Hände in den Hüften, das Klavier lieber anstaunte. Auch die Akustik des
Zimmers war ausgezeichnet und sie trug dazu bei, ein anfängliches
kleines Unbehagen, in einem Eisenhause zu wohnen, gänzlich verschwinden
zu lassen. Tatsächlich merkte man auch im Zimmer, so eisenmäßig das
Gebäude von außen erschien, von eisernen Baubestandteilen nicht das
geringste, und niemand hätte auch nur eine Kleinigkeit in der
Einrichtung aufzeigen können, welche die vollständigste Gemütlichkeit
irgendwie gestört hätte. Karl erhoffte in der ersten Zeit viel von
seinem Klavierspiel und schämte sich nicht, wenigstens vor dem
Einschlafen an die Möglichkeit einer unmittelbaren Beeinflussung der
amerikanischen Verhältnisse durch dieses Klavierspiel zu denken. Er
klang ja allerdings sonderbar, wenn er vor den in die lärmerfüllte Luft
geöffneten Fenstern ein altes Soldatenlied seiner Heimat spielte, das
die Soldaten am Abend, wenn sie in den Kasernenfenstern liegen und auf
den finsteren Platz hinausschauen, von Fenster zu Fenster einander
zusingen - aber sah er dann auf die Straße, so war sie unverändert und
nur ein kleines Stück eines großen Kreislaufes, das man nicht an und für
sich anhalten konnte, ohne alle Kräfte zu kennen, die in der Runde
wirkten. Der Onkel duldete das Klavierspiel, sagte auch nichts dagegen,
zumal sich Karl, auch nach seiner Mahnung, nur selten das Vergnügen des
Spiels gönnte; ja, er brachte Karl sogar Noten amerikanischer Märsche
und natürlich auch der Nationalhymne, aber allein aus der Freude an der
Musik war es wohl nicht zu erklären, als er eines Tages ohne allen
Scherz Karl fragte, ob er nicht auch das Spiel auf der Geige oder auf
dem Waldhorn lernen wolle. Natürlich war das Lernen des Englischen Karls
erste und wichtigste Aufgabe. Ein junger Professor einer
Handelshochschule erschien morgens um sieben Uhr in Karls Zimmer und
fand ihn schon an seinem Schreibtisch und bei den Heften sitzen oder
memorierend im Zimmer auf und ab gehen. Karl sah wohl ein, daß zur
Aneignung des Englischen keine Eile groß genug sei und daß er hier
außerdem die beste Gelegenheit habe, seinem Onkel eine außerordentliche
Freude durch rasche Fortschritte zu machen. Und tatsächlich gelang es
bald, während zuerst das Englische in den Gesprächen mit dem Onkel sich
auf Gruß und Abschiedsworte beschränkt hatte, immer größere Teile der
Gespräche ins Englische hinüberzuspielen, wodurch gleichzeitig
vertraulichere Themen sich einzustellen begannen. Das erste
amerikanische Gedicht, die Darstellung einer Feuersbrunst, das Karl
seinem Onkel an einem Abend rezitieren konnte, machte diesen tiefernst
vor Zufriedenheit. Sie standen damals beide an einem Fenster in Karls
Zimmer, der Onkel sah hinaus, wo alle Helligkeit des Himmels schon
vergangen war, und schlug im Mitgefühl der Verse langsam und gleichmäßig
in die Hände, während Karl aufrecht neben ihm stand und mit starren
Augen das schwierige Gedicht sich entrang. Je besser Karls Englisch
wurde, desto größere Lust zeigte der Onkel, ihn mit seinen Bekannten
zusammenzuführen, und ordnete nur für jeden Fall an, daß bei solchen
Zusammenkünften vorläufig der Englischprofessor sich immer in Karls Nähe
zu halten habe. Der allererste Bekannte, dem Karl eines Vormittags
vorgestellt wurde, war ein schlanker, junger, unglaublich biegsamer
Mensch, den der Onkel mit besonderen Komplimenten in Karls Zimmer
führte. Er war offenbar einer jener vielen, vom Standpunkt der Eltern
aus gesehen, mißratenen Millionärssöhne, dessen Leben so verlief, daß
ein gewöhnlicher Mensch auch nur einen beliebigen Tag im Leben dieses
jungen Mannes nicht ohne Schmerz verfolgen konnte. Und als wisse oder
ahne er dies und als begegne er dem, soweit es in seiner Macht stand,
war um seine Lippen und Augen ein unaufhörliches Lächeln des Glückes,
das ihm selbst, seinem Gegenüber und der ganzen Welt zu gelten schien.
Mit diesem jungen Manne, einem Herrn Mack, wurde, unter unbedingter
Zustimmung des Onkels, besprochen, gemeinsam um halb sechs Uhr früh, sei
es in der Reitschule, sei es ins Freie, zu reiten. Karl zögerte zuerst,
seine Zusage zu geben, da er doch noch niemals auf einem Pferd gesessen
war und das Reiten zuerst ein wenig lernen wolle, aber da ihm der Onkel
und Mack so sehr zuredeten und das Reiten als bloßes Vergnügen und als
gesunde Übung, aber gar nicht als Kunst darstellten, sagte er
schließlich zu. Nun mußte er allerdings schon um halb fünf Uhr aus dem
Bett, und das tat ihm oft sehr leid, denn er litt hier, wohl infolge der
steten Aufmerksamkeit, die er während des Tages aufwenden mußte,
geradezu an Schlafsucht, aber in seinem Badezimmer verlor sich das
Bedauern bald. Über die ganze Wanne der Länge und Breite nach spannte
sich das Sieb der Dusche - welcher Mitschüler zu Hause, und war er noch
so reich, besaß etwas Derartiges und gar noch allein für sich -, und da
lag nun Karl ausgestreckt, in dieser Wanne konnte er die Arme
ausbreiten, und ließ die Ströme des lauen, heißen, wieder lauen und
endlich eisigen Wassers nach Belieben teilweise oder über die ganze
Fläche hin auf sich herab. Wie in dem noch ein wenig fortlaufenden
Genusse des Schlafes lag er da und fing besonders gern mit den
geschlossenen Augenlidern die letzten, einzeln fallenden Tropfen auf,
die sich dann öffneten und über das Gesicht hinflossen. In der
Reitschule, wo ihn das hoch sich aufbauende Automobil des Onkels
absetzte, erwartete ihn bereits der Englischprofessor, während Mack
ausnahmslos erst später kam. Er konnte aber auch unbesorgt erst später
kommen, denn das eigentliche, lebendige Reiten fing erst an, wenn er da
war. Bäumten sich nicht die Pferde aus ihrem bisherigen Halbschlaf auf,
wenn er eintrat, knallte die Peitsche nicht lauter durch den Raum,
erschienen nicht plötzlich auf der umlaufenden Galerie einzelne
Personen, Zuschauer, Pferdewärter, Reitschüler oder was sie sonst sein
mochten? Karl aber nützte die Zeit vor der Ankunft Macks dazu aus, um
doch ein wenig, wenn auch nur die primitivsten Vorübungen des Reitens zu
betreiben. Es war ein langer Mann da, der auf den höchsten Pferderücken
mit kaum erhobenem Arm hinaufreichte und der Karl diesen immer kaum eine
Viertelstunde dauernden Unterricht erteilte. Die Erfolge, die Karl
hierbei hatte, waren nicht übergroß, und er konnte sich viele englische
Klagerufe dauernd aneignen, die er während dieses Lernens zu seinem
Englischprofessor atemlos ausstieß, der immer am Türpfosten, meist
schlafbedürftig, lehnte. Aber fast alle Unzufriedenheit mit dem Reiten
hörte auf, wenn Mack kam. Der lange Mann wurde weggeschickt, und bald
hörte man in dem noch immer halbdunklen Saal nichts anderes als die Hufe
der galoppierenden Pferde und man sah kaum etwas anderes als Macks
erhobenen Arm, mit dem er Karl ein Kommando gab. Nach einer halben
Stunde solchen wie Schlaf vergehenden Vergnügens wurde haltgemacht. Mack
war in großer Eile, verabschiedete sich von Karl, klopfte ihm manchmal
auf die Wange, wenn er mit seinem Reiten besonders zufrieden gewesen
war, und verschwand, ohne vor großer Eile mit Karl auch nur gemeinsam
durch die Tür hinauszugehen. Karl nahm dann den Professor mit ins
Automobil, und sie fuhren zu ihrer Englischstunde meist auf Umwegen,
denn bei der Fahrt durch das Gedränge der großen Straße, die eigentlich
direkt von dem Hause des Onkels zur Reitschule führte, wäre zuviel Zeit
verlorengegangen. Im übrigen hörte wenigstens diese Begleitung des
Englischprofessors bald auf, denn Karl, der sich Vorwürfe machte, den
müden Mann nutzlos in die Reitschule zu bemühen, zumal die englische
Verständigung mit Mack eine sehr einfache war, bat den Onkel, den
Professor von dieser Pflicht zu entheben. Nach einiger Überlegung gab
der Onkel dieser Bitte auch nach. Verhältnismäßig lange dauerte es, ehe
sich der Onkel entschloß, Karl auch nur einen kleinen Einblick in sein
Geschäft zu erlauben, obwohl Karl öfters darum ersucht hatte. Es war
eine Art Kommissions- und Speditionsgeschäftes, wie sie, soweit sich
Karl erinnern konnte, in Europa vielleicht gar nicht zu finden war. Das
Geschäft bestand nämlich in einem Zwischenhandel, der aber die Waren
nicht etwa von den Produzenten zu den Konsumenten oder vielleicht zu den
Händlern vermittelte, sondern welcher die Vermittlung aller Waren und
Urprodukte für die großen Fabrikskartelle und zwischen ihnen besorgte.
Es war daher ein Geschäft, welches in einem Käufe, Lagerungen,
Transporte und Verkäufe riesenhaften Umfangs umfaßte und ganz genaue,
unaufhörliche telephonische und telegraphische Verbindungen mit den
Klienten unterhalten mußte. Der Saal der Telegraphen war nicht kleiner,
sondern größer als das Telegraphenamt der Vaterstadt, durch das Karl
einmal an der Hand eines dort bekannten Mitschülers gegangen war. Im
Saal der Telephone gingen, wohin man schaute, die Türen der
Telephonzellen auf und zu, und das Läuten war sinnverwirrend. Der Onkel
öffnete die nächste dieser Türen, und man sah dort im sprühenden
elektrischen Licht einen Angestellten, gleichgültig gegen jedes Geräusch
der Türe, den Kopf eingespannt in ein Stahlband, das ihm die Hörmuscheln
an die Ohren drückte. Der rechte Arm lag auf einem Tischchen, als wäre
er besonders schwer, und nur die Finger, welche den Bleistift hielten,
zuckten unmenschlich gleichmäßig und rasch. In den Worten, die er in den
Sprechtrichter sagte, war er sehr sparsam, und oft sah man sogar, daß er
vielleicht gegen den Sprecher etwas einzuwenden hatte, ihn etwas genauer
fragen wollte, aber gewisse Worte, die er hörte, zwangen ihn, ehe er
seine Absicht ausführen konnte, die Augen zu senken und zu schreiben. Er
mußte auch nicht reden, wie der Onkel Karl leise erklärte, denn die
gleichen Meldungen, wie sie dieser Mann aufnahm, wurden noch von zwei
anderen Angestellten gleichzeitig aufgenommen und dann verglichen, so
daß Irrtümer möglichst ausgeschlossen waren. In dem gleichen Augenblick,
als der Onkel und Karl aus der Tür getreten waren, schlüpfte ein
Praktikant hinein und kann mit dem inzwischen beschriebenen Papier
heraus. Mitten durch den Saal war ein beständiger Verkehr von hin und
her gejagten Leuten. Keiner grüßte, das Grüßen war abgeschafft, jeder
schloß sich den Schritten des ihm Vorhergehenden an und sah auf den
Boden, auf dem er möglichst rasch vorwärtskommen wollte, oder fing mit
den Blicken wohl nur einzelne Worte oder Zahlen von Papieren ab, die er
in der Hand hielt und die bei seinem Laufschritt flatterten. »Du hast es
wirklich weit gebracht«, sagte Karl einmal auf einem dieser Gänge durch
den Betrieb, auf dessen Durchsicht man viele Tage verwenden mußte,
selbst wenn man jede Abteilung gerade nur gesehen haben wollte. »Und
alles habe ich vor dreißig Jahren selbst eingerichtet, mußt du wissen.
Ich hatte damals im Hafenviertel ein kleines Geschäft, und wenn dort im
Tag fünf Kisten abgeladen waren, so war es viel und ich ging aufgeblasen
nach Hause. Heute habe ich die drittgrößten Lagerhäuser im Hafen, und
jener Laden ist das Eßzimmer und die Gerätekammer der fünfundsechzigsten
Gruppe meiner Packträger.« »Das grenzt ja ans Wunderbare«, sagte Karl.
»Alle Entwicklungen gehen hier so schnell vor sich«, sagte der Onkel,
das Gespräch abbrechend. Eines Tages kam der Onkel knapp vor der Zeit
des Essens, das Karl wie gewöhnlich allein einzunehmen gedachte, und
forderte ihn auf, sich gleichfalls schwarz anzuziehen und mit ihm zum
Essen zu kommen, an welchem zwei Geschäftsfreunde teilnehmen würden.
Während Karl sich im Nebenzimmer umkleidete, setzte sich der Onkel zum
Schreibtisch und sah die gerade beendete Englischaufgabe durch, schlug
mit der Hand auf den Tisch und rief laut: »Wirklich ausgezeichnet!«
Zweifellos gelang das Anziehen besser, als Karl dieses Lob hörte, aber
er war auch wirklich seines Englischen schon ziemlich sicher. Im
Speisezimmer des Onkels, das er vom ersten Abend seiner Ankunft noch in
Erinnerung hatte, erhoben sich zwei große, dicke Herren zur Begrüßung,
ein gewisser Green der eine, ein gewisser Pollunder der zweite, wie sich
während des Tischgesprächs herausstellte. Der Onkel pflegte nämlich kaum
ein flüchtiges Wort über irgendwelche Bekannten auszusprechen und
überließ es immer Karl, durch eigene Beobachtung das Notwendige oder
Interessante herauszufinden. Nachdem während des eigentlichen Essens nur
intime geschäftliche Angelegenheiten besprochen worden waren, was für
Karl eine gute Lektion hinsichtlich kaufmännischer Ausdrücke bedeutete,
und man Karl still mit seinem Essen sich hatte beschäftigen lassen, als
sei er ein Kind, das sich vor allem ordentlich sattessen müsse, beugte
sich Herr Green zu Karl hin und fragte in dem unverkennbaren Bestreben,
ein möglichst deutliches Englisch zu sprechen, im allgemeinen nach Karls
ersten amerikanischen Eindrücken. Karl antwortete unter einer
Sterbensstille ringsherum mit einigen Seitenblicken auf den Onkel
ziemlich ausführlich und suchte sich zum Dank durch eine etwas New
Yorkisch gefärbte Redeweise angenehm zu machen. Bei einem Ausdruck
lachten sogar alle drei Herren durcheinander, und Karl fürchtete schon,
einen groben Fehler gemacht zu haben; jedoch nein, er hatte, wie Herr
Pollunder erklärte, sogar etwas sehr Gelungenes gesagt. Dieser Herr
Pollunder schien überhaupt an Karl ein besonderes Gefallen zu finden,
und während der Onkel und Herr Green wieder zu den geschäftlichen
Besprechungen zurückkehrten, ließ Herr Pollunder Karl seinen Sessel nahe
zu sich hinschieben, fragte ihn zuerst vielerlei über seinen Namen,
seine Herkunft und seine Reise aus, bis er dann schließlich, um Karl
wieder ausruhen zu lassen, lachend, hustend und eilig selbst von sich
und seiner Tochter erzählte, mit der er auf einem kleinen Landgut in der
Nähe von New York wohnte, wo er aber allerdings nur die Abende
verbringen konnte, denn er war Bankier, und sein Beruf hielt ihn in New
York den ganzen Tag fest. Karl wurde auch gleich herzlichst eingeladen,
auf dieses Landgut hinauszukommen, ein so frischgebackener Amerikaner
wie Karl habe ja auch sicher das Bedürfnis, sich von New York manchmal
zu erholen. Karl bat den Onkel sofort um die Erlaubnis, diese Einladung
annehmen zu dürfen, und der Onkel gab auch scheinbar freudig diese
Erlaubnis, ohne aber ein bestimmtes Datum zu nennen oder auch nur in
Erwägung ziehen zu lassen, wie es Karl und Herr Pollunder erwartet
hatten. Aber schon am nächsten Tag wurde Karl in ein Büro des Onkels
beordert (der Onkel hatte zehn verschiedene Büros allein in diesem
Hause), wo er den Onkel und Herrn Pollunder ziemlich einsilbig in den
Fauteuils liegend antraf. »Herr Pollunder,« sagte der Onkel, er war in
der Abenddämmerung des Zimmers kaum zu erkennen, »Herr Pollunder ist
gekommen, um dich auf sein Landgut mitzunehmen, wie wir es gestern
besprochen haben.« »Ich wußte nicht, daß es schon heute sein sollte«,
antwortete Karl, »sonst wäre ich schon vorbereitet.« »Wenn du nicht
vorbereitet bist, dann verschieben wir vielleicht den Besuch besser für
nächstens«, meinte der Onkel. »Was für Vorbereitungen!« rief Herr
Pollunder. »Ein junger Mann ist immer vorbereitet.« »Es ist nicht
seinetwegen«, sagte der Onkel, zu seinem Gäste gewendet, »aber er müßte
immerhin noch in sein Zimmer hinaufgehen, und Sie wären aufgehalten.«
»Es ist auch dazu reichlich Zeit«, sagte Herr Pollunder, »ich habe auch
eine Verzögerung vorbedacht und früher Geschäftsschluß gemacht.« »Du
siehst«, sagte der Onkel, »was für Unannehmlichkeiten dein Besuch schon
jetzt veranlaßt.« »Es tut mir leid«, sagte Karl, »aber ich werde gleich
wieder da sein«, und wollte schon wegspringen. »Übereilen Sie sich
nicht«, sagte Herr Pollunder. »Sie machen mir nicht die geringsten
Unannehmlichkeiten, dagegen macht mir Ihr Besuch eine reine Freude.« »Du
versäumst morgen deine Reitstunde, hast du sie schon abgesagt?« »Nein«,
sagte Karl, dieser Besuch, auf den er sich gefreut hatte, fing an, eine
Last zu werden, »ich wußte ja nicht -« »Und trotzdem willst du
wegfahren?« fragte der Onkel weiter. Herr Pollunder, dieser freundliche
Mensch, kam zu Hilfe. »Wir werden auf der Fahrt bei der Reitschule
halten und die Sache in Ordnung bringen.« »Das läßt sich hören«, sagte
der Onkel. »Aber Mack wird dich doch erwarten.« »Erwarten wird er mich
nicht«, sagte Karl, »aber er wird allerdings hinkommen.« »Nun also?«
sagte der Onkel, als wäre Karls Antwort nicht die geringste
Rechtfertigung gewesen. Wieder sagte Herr Pollunder das Entscheidende:
»Aber Klara« - sie war Herrn Pollunders Tochter - »erwartet ihn auch und
schon heute abend, und sie hat wohl den Vorzug vor Mack?« »Allerdings«,
sagte der Onkel. »Also lauf schon in dein Zimmer«, und er schlug
mehrmals wie ohne Willen gegen die Armlehne des Fauteuils. Karl war
schon bei der Tür, als ihn der Onkel noch mit der Frage zurückhielt:
»Zur Englischstunde bist du doch wohl morgen früh wieder hier?« »Aber!«
rief Herr Pollunder und drehte sich, soweit es seine Dicke erlaubte, in
seinem Fauteuil vor Erstaunen. »Ja darf er denn nicht wenigstens den
morgigen Tag draußen bleiben? Ich brächte ihn dann übermorgen früh
wieder zurück?« »Das geht auf keinen Fall«, erwiderte der Onkel. »Ich
kann sein Studium nicht so in Unordnung kommen lassen. Später, wenn er
in einem an und für sich geregelten Berufsleben sein wird, werde ich ihm
sehr gern auch für längere Zeit erlauben, einer so freundlichen und
ehrenden Einladung zu folgen.« &gt;Was das für Widersprüche sind!&lt;
dachte Karl. Herr Pollunder war traurig geworden. »Für einen Abend und
eine Nacht steht es aber wirklich fast nicht dafür.« »Das war auch meine
Meinung«, sagte der Onkel. »Man muß nehmen, was man bekommt«, sagte Herr
Pollunder und lachte schon wieder. »Also, ich warte!« rief er Karl zu,
welcher, da der Onkel nichts mehr sagte, davoneilte. Als er bald
reisefertig zurückkehrte, traf er im Büro nur noch Herrn Pollunder, der
Onkel war fortgegangen. Herr Pollunder schüttelte Karl ganz glücklich
beide Hände, als wolle er sich so stark als möglich dessen vergewissern,
daß Karl nun doch mitfahre. Karl war noch ganz erhitzt von der Eile und
schüttelte auch seinerseits Herrn Pollunders Hände, er freute sich, den
Ausflug machen zu können. »Hat sich der Onkel nicht darüber geärgert,
daß ich fahre?« »Aber nein! Das hat er ja alles nicht so ernst gemeint.
Ihre Erziehung liegt ihm eben am Herzen.« »Hat er es Ihnen selbst
gesagt, daß er das Frühere nicht so ernst gemeint hat?« »O ja«, sagte
Herr Pollunder gedehnt und bewies damit, daß er nicht lügen konnte. »Es
ist merkwürdig, wie ungern er mir die Erlaubnis gegeben hat, Sie zu
besuchen, obwohl Sie doch sein Freund sind.« Auch Herr Pollunder konnte,
obwohl er dies nicht offen eingestand, keine Erklärung dafür finden, und
beide dachten, als sie in Herrn Pollunders Automobil durch den warmen
Abend fuhren, noch lange darüber nach, obwohl sie gleich von anderen
Dingen sprachen. Sie saßen eng beieinander, und Herr Pollunder hielt
Karls Hand in der seinen, während er erzählte. Karl wollte vieles über
das Fräulein Klara hören, als sei er ungeduldig über die lange Fahrt und
könne mit Hilfe der Erzählungen früher ankommen als in Wirklichkeit.
Obwohl er am Abend noch niemals durch die New Yorker Straßen gefahren
war, und über Trottoir und Fahrbahn, alle Augenblicke die Richtung
wechselnd, wie in einem Wirbelwind der Lärm jagte, nicht wie von
Menschen verursacht, sondern wie ein fremdes Element, kümmerte sich
Karl, während er Herrn Pollunders Worte genau aufzunehmen suchte, um
nichts anderes als Herrn Pollunders dunkle Weste, über die quer eine
dunkle Kette ruhig hing. Aus den Straßen, wo das Publikum in großer,
unverhüllter Furcht vor Verspätung in fliegendem Schritt und in
Fahrzeugen, die zu möglichster Eile gebracht waren, zu den Theatern
drängte, kamen sie durch Übergangsbezirke in die Vorstädte, wo ihr
Automobil durch Polizeileute zu Pferd immer wieder in Seitenstraßen
gewiesen wurde, da die großen Straßen von den demonstrierenden
Metallarbeitern, die im Streik standen, besetzt waren und nur der
notwendigste Wagenverkehr an den Kreuzungsstellen gestattet werden
konnte. Durchquerte dann das Automobil, aus dunkleren, dumpf hallenden
Gassen kommend, eine dieser ganzen Plätzen gleichenden großen Straßen,
dann erschienen nach beiden Seiten hin in Perspektiven, denen niemand
bis zum Ende folgen konnte, die Trottoirs angefüllt mit einer in
winzigen Schritten sich bewegenden Masse, deren Gesang einheitlicher war
als der einer einzigen Menschenstimme. In der freigehaltenen Fahrbahn
aber sah man hie und da einen Polizisten auf unbeweglichem Pferde oder
Träger von Fahnen oder beschriebenen, über die Straße gespannten Tüchern
oder einen von Mitarbeitern und Ordonnanzen umgebenen Arbeiterführer
oder einen Wagen der elektrischen Straßenbahn, der sich nicht rasch
genug geflüchtet hatte und nun leer und dunkel dastand, während der
Führer und der Schaffner auf der Plattform saßen. Kleine Trupps von
Neugierigen standen weit entfernt von den wirklichen Demonstranten und
verließen ihre Plätze nicht, obwohl sie über die eigentlichen Ereignisse
im unklaren blieben. Karl aber lehnte froh in dem Arm, den Herr
Pollunder um ihn gelegt hatte; die Überzeugung, daß er bald in einem
beleuchteten, von Mauern umgebenen, von Hunden bewachten Landhause ein
willkommener Gast sein werde, tat ihm über alle Maßen wohl, und wenn er
auch wegen einer beginnenden Schläfrigkeit nicht mehr alles, was Herr
Pollunder sagte, fehlerlos oder wenigstens nicht ohne Unterbrechung
auffaßte, so raffte er sich doch von Zeit zu Zeit auf und wischte sich
die Augen, um wieder für eine Weile festzustellen, ob Herr Pollunder
seine Schläfrigkeit bemerkte, denn das wollte er um jeden Preis
vermieden wissen. | 4650| 30294|</p>
