Here you can find resources that will allow you to make the most of our summer school, as well as the program, and information on the corpus we will use in the several exercises and practice sessions that will be the core of the summer school. You will also find some recommended readings, which might give you an idea of what Digital Literary Studies are about.

Please also visit the dedicated page on the ZÃ¼rich Zentralbibliothek website to read the abstracts of the plenary sessions and see more details on the events.
